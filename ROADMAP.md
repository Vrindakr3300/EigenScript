# Roadmap

Current version: **0.10.0**

## Near-term

- [ ] Dict field inline caching (OP_DOT_GET with cached slot offset)
- [ ] Extend GET_LOCAL/SET_LOCAL to all local variables (not just params)
- [ ] Fix remaining 15 edge-case test failures
- [ ] Streaming subprocess I/O (stdin pipe, unbuffered stdout)
- [ ] More STEM modules (graph theory, regression/curve fitting, numerical PDEs)

## Medium-term

- [ ] WASM compilation target
- [ ] Destructuring assignment
- [ ] Package manager / module registry
- [ ] Chunk reference counting (currently leaked to keep closures alive)

## Long-term

- [ ] Self-hosting compiler (EigenScript written in EigenScript)
- [ ] Foreign function interface (FFI) for calling C libraries

## Completed (0.10.0)

- [x] Bytecode VM — replaced AST tree-walker with compiled bytecode + computed-goto dispatch
- [x] Non-recursive function calls — no C stack recursion, 4096 frame depth
- [x] Stack-local optimization — GET_LOCAL/SET_LOCAL for function params
- [x] Observer stall detection in VM loops (OP_LOOP_STALL_CHECK)
- [x] list_truncate, list_remove_at, sort_by builtins

## Completed (0.9.3)

- [x] Computational geometry library (EigenScript's namesake) — 60+ functions, convex hull, transforms
- [x] Lab data collection framework — experiment management with observer-aware measurement analysis

## Completed (0.9.2)

- [x] STEM standard library — 12 modules: physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, earth_science, linalg, calculus, probability, optimize, simulation, numerics, experiment
- [x] Observer-aware computation — optimization, simulation, iterative methods, and experimental analysis that leverage EigenScript's native convergence detection
- [x] SDL2 audio extension — synthesis (sine/saw/square/noise), playback, mixing, ADSR envelope
- [x] Code formatter (`--fmt`) and linter (`--lint`) built into binary
- [x] Valgrind leak fix (2MB → 1.8KB per run), shellcheck clean test runner
- [x] Tidepool near-parity: creature system, combat, mating, editor, camera zoom, particles, high scores

## Completed (0.9.1)

- [x] Statistics library — mean, median, std_dev, histogram, correlation, describe
- [x] Graphical debugger with observer-aware variable inspection
- [x] Meta-circular interpreter at full language parity (dicts, lambdas, imports, observer)
- [x] Index-assignment syntax (`list[i] is val`, `dict[key] is val`)
- [x] SDL2 enhancements (rounded rects, clip rects, mouse wheel, modifier keys, window resize)
- [x] 817 tests, eval.c at 96.6% coverage

## Completed (0.8.0)

- [x] Reference counting garbage collection
- [x] `unobserved:` blocks — opt-out of observer tracking, in-place numeric mutation
- [x] SDL2 graphics extension (13 builtins: window, shapes, text, events, timing)
- [x] Bitmap font text rendering (`gfx_text`)
- [x] Bitwise operations (`bit_and`, `bit_or`, `bit_xor`, `bit_not`, `bit_shl`, `bit_shr`)
- [x] Terminal I/O (`write`, `flush`, `raw_key`, `usleep`)
- [x] `join` as C builtin (O(n) string concatenation)
- [x] `monotonic_ns` / `monotonic_ms` — high-resolution monotonic timer
- [x] System stdlib resolution (`~/.local/lib/eigenscript/`)
- [x] `make install` installs stdlib alongside binary
- [x] Gap analysis document (`docs/GAP_ANALYSIS.md`)
- [x] Source split: `eigenscript.c` → `lexer.c`, `parser.c`, `eval.c`, `builtins.c`
- [x] Security hardening (strbuf, OOM-safe alloc, recursion guard, softmax NaN guard)
- [x] Fuzz testing infrastructure (44 edge case + adversarial tests under ASAN+UBSan)

## Completed (0.7.0)
