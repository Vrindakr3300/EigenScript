All notable changes to EigenScript are documented here.

## [0.14.1] — 2026-06-13

### Fix — macOS Intel JIT page mapping

- **JIT cache pages now use `MAP_JIT` + `pthread_jit_write_protect_np`
  on Apple platforms.** The previous
  `mmap(PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE)` → `mprotect(PROT_READ|PROT_EXEC)` W→X
  transition is rejected under macOS 15's hardened runtime — every
  thunk SIGSEGV'd on first entry, taking 348/1857 tests down on the
  macos-15-intel runner during the 0.14.0 release build. The
  macos-x86_64 runner is new for 0.14.0; v0.13.0's single-job workflow
  never exercised it, so the failure mode was latent. `src/jit.c`
  branches on `__APPLE__` for the mapping flags and seal/unseal
  primitives; Linux behavior is unchanged. macos-arm64 stays
  interpreter-only (the JIT itself remains x86_64-gated).
- Suite remains 1857/1857 release + ASan with `detect_leaks=1` (leak
  tally still 13).

## [0.14.0] — 2026-06-13

### Trust/identity — OpenSSF badge, CodeQL, Scorecard 7.5/10, signed releases, OSS-Fuzz in flight

- **OpenSSF Best Practices passing badge earned** (project 13187,
  100% at 2026-06-13 09:27 UTC —
  https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/13187). Badge embed lives in
  the README alongside CI/Release/License/Stars. Silver sits at 13%
  and gold at 22%; the gaps are governance/DCO/vulnerability-response
  process families, not core security work.
- **CodeQL workflow** (`.github/workflows/codeql.yml`) runs the
  `security-and-quality` query pack on every push, every PR, and a
  weekly cron — added to satisfy `static_analysis` and to surface
  alerts in the repo's Security tab. Triage the same cadence as
  ASan/leak-tally failures.
- **OpenSSF Scorecard 7.5/10** (`.github/workflows/scorecard.yml`):
  10/10 on twelve checks including SAST, CI-Tests, Fuzzing,
  Dependency-Update-Tool, Pinned-Dependencies, Token-Permissions,
  Maintained, Security-Policy, License, Vulnerabilities,
  Dangerous-Workflow, Binary-Artifacts. Workflow hardening: every
  third-party action is pinned to its commit SHA (Dependabot config
  added for weekly bumps); top-level workflow tokens default to
  read-only with `contents: write` / `pages: write` / `id-token: write`
  scoped to the jobs that need them. Remaining gaps are structural
  (solo Code-Review, Branch-Protection vs. direct-push workflow) or
  bump only at Gold-tier Best Practices.
- **Signed releases via Sigstore build provenance**
  (`actions/attest-build-provenance` in `release.yml`). Every release
  binary — `eigenscript-{linux,macos}-{x86_64,arm64}` and the Linux
  `eigenscript-full` variant — gets a keyless attestation written to
  the GitHub attestations API, plus an `attestation.sigstore.json`
  bundle uploaded alongside the binaries for offline verification.
  Per-binary verification: `gh attestation verify eigenscript-<label>
  --repo InauguralSystems/EigenScript`. This is the first EigenScript
  release to ship signed artifacts.
- **OSS-Fuzz enrollment**: PR google/oss-fuzz#15720 submitted from the
  InauguralSystems org fork with the CLA signed; all checks green
  except trial-build (NEUTRAL, non-blocking). The libFuzzer harness
  (`fuzz/fuzz_eigenscript.c`) was rewritten to drive the current
  bytecode pipeline (the AST-interpreter-era harness had bitrotted),
  paired with a keyword/punctuation/builtin dictionary
  (`fuzz/eigenscript.dict`) and a `make fuzz-libfuzzer` target
  (`clang -fsanitize=fuzzer,address,undefined`).

### Package ecosystem — CONTRIBUTING section + awesome-eigenscript (package design Phase 2)

- **CONTRIBUTING.md gains a "Publishing a Package" section.** Covers
  naming (lowercase identifiers, no hyphens, stdlib name reservations),
  semver discipline (cut new tags rather than force-pushing), the
  privacy convention (leading underscore), the "no top-level side
  effects" footgun, and where to list a published package.
- **New repo: [InauguralSystems/awesome-eigenscript](
  https://github.com/InauguralSystems/awesome-eigenscript).** Curated
  index of packages, tools, learning resources, and editor integrations.
  A list, not a registry — the package tool resolves packages by git
  URL, so this index is purely for discoverability. PRs add one entry
  per package; inclusion gated on tagged release + smoke test in CI.

### Package starter — `eigs-package-template` (package design Phase 1 wrap)

- **New repo: [InauguralSystems/eigs-package-template](
  https://github.com/InauguralSystems/eigs-package-template).** A
  forkable starting point for an EigenScript package: `eigs.json` +
  `<name>.eigs` at the root, MIT license, a smoke test that stages
  the package into `eigs_modules/<name>/` and imports it the way a
  consumer would, and a CI workflow that builds EigenScript from
  source. Tagged `v0.1.0` to demonstrate the semver workflow.
- The Phase 1 design called for this; it lands as a sibling repo
  rather than docs in this tree so authors `gh repo fork` it.

### Package tool — `--pkg verify` + `--pkg update` (package design Phase 1c)

- **`--pkg verify`** re-checks every installed dep against the lockfile.
  Three failure modes per package: the checkout is missing, `HEAD`
  differs from the locked commit, or the working tree has been edited
  (`git status --porcelain` non-empty). Exits nonzero (via `throw`) if
  any package fails so CI can gate on it.
- **`--pkg update [name]`** re-resolves the manifest tag to its current
  `HEAD` and re-locks. With no arg, walks every dep; with a name, only
  that one (unknown name → nonzero exit). The manifest itself is
  unchanged — `update` moves only the lockfile.
- **Lockfile gains a `tree` field**: git's `HEAD^{tree}` SHA, recorded
  by `add` / `install` / `update` and re-checked by `verify`. The
  commit SHA already nails down git history; the tree hash is the
  content-addressed identifier of the tree itself, and pre-1c
  lockfiles are backfilled on the next `install`.
- Suite gains section [96] (`tests/test_pkg_verify_update.sh`,
  7 checks): clean verify, tampered-tree verify, missing-checkout
  verify, update no-op on unchanged tag, update advances lockfile
  after a tag move, unknown-name update exits nonzero, and verify
  accepts the post-update state.

### Package tool — `--pkg add` + `--pkg install` actually fetch (package design Phase 1b)

- **`--pkg add <name> <url> [tag]` now clones the dep** into
  `eigs_modules/<name>/` via `git clone --depth 1 --branch <tag>`,
  resolves `HEAD` with `git -C <dir> rev-parse HEAD`, and records
  `{git, tag, commit}` in `eigs.lock.json`. The manifest write
  happens *before* the network step so a failed clone leaves a
  recoverable on-disk state — re-run `--pkg install` to retry.
- **`--pkg install` reproduces `eigs_modules/` from the lockfile.**
  For each manifest dep: wipe the target dir, re-clone at the manifest
  tag, then — if the lockfile pins a commit — `git fetch --depth 1
  origin <commit>` + `git checkout <commit>` so a force-pushed tag
  cannot sneak a different tree past the lock. Install is idempotent
  (re-running over a populated `eigs_modules/` is a no-op-equivalent
  refresh) and never leaves the tree in a half-state.
- **No code from the dep is executed at install time** — the runtime
  only ever loads `eigs_modules/<name>/<name>.eigs` when the user
  script actually `import`s it.
- Suite gains section [95] (`tests/test_pkg_fetch.sh`): builds a
  local `file://` git repo as a fake remote, runs the full add →
  import → install round-trip, and verifies the lockfile-wins-over-
  moved-tag invariant by force-retagging the source.

### Package tool — `--pkg` skeleton (package design Phase 1a)

- **New CLI: `eigenscript --pkg <subcommand>`.** Dispatcher loads
  `lib/pkg.eigs` and forwards subcommand args to it. Wired alongside
  `--fmt` and `--lint` in `src/main.c`. The tool is written in
  EigenScript itself (`lib/pkg.eigs`) so it dogfoods the JSON,
  subprocess, and file-I/O surface.
- **Subcommands landed: `list`, `add`, `help`.** `add` writes the dep
  to `eigs.json`; `list` prints what's recorded plus the locked
  commit if present in `eigs.lock.json`. `install`, `verify`,
  `update` are stubs in this slice — they land in Phase 1b and 1c.
- **Unknown subcommand exits nonzero** via `throw`, so CI / shell
  pipelines fail loudly on typos. The manifest and lockfile use the
  built-in `json_encode`/`json_decode` — no new dependency.

### Modules — import cache + per-file resolution + eigs_modules/ (package design Phase 0a/b/c)

- **`import name` now searches `eigs_modules/<name>/<name>.eigs`,
  walking upward from the importing file's directory to the project
  root** (a directory containing `eigs.json`, checked once and then
  the walk halts). Only fires for bare `<name>.eigs` requests, so
  paths with directory components fall through the existing chain
  unchanged. Walks are bounded to 64 levels. This is the runtime hook
  for the `eigs_modules/` layout that the future `--pkg` tool will
  populate; the resolver gains the lookup now so a hand-curated
  `eigs_modules/` works today.
- **Resolver ordering.** Within the `import` resolver chain, the
  package step sits between the cwd-relative check and the
  importer-dir (`base`) check, so a packaged dep wins over a
  loose file next to the importer. Stdlib and `eigs_modules/` may
  collide on a name; the future `--pkg add` tool will reject collisions
  at install time per the design.


- **`import` now caches the resolved module.** The first import of a
  module executes its body; subsequent imports of the same resolved
  absolute path bind the same dict and reuse the same module Env. A
  side-effecting top-level statement (e.g. `print of "init"`) runs
  exactly once across all importers; diamond dependencies (`a → c`,
  `b → c`) share one instance of `c`'s state. Cache is keyed on the
  `realpath`-canonicalized resolved path so different relative routes
  to the same file hit the same entry. Cleared in `gc_collect_at_exit`
  before the global-scope snapshot.
- **`import` inside a module resolves relative to *that module's*
  directory.** Previously every nested import searched from the main
  script's directory, so a submodule couldn't reliably reach its own
  peers. Now the resolver's script-relative step anchors at the
  importing file's own directory (derived from its `realpath`-
  canonicalized absolute path, so symlinks and `..` segments are
  flattened). The other steps in the chain (cwd, exe-relative, stdlib
  `$HOME/.local/lib/eigenscript`) are unchanged.
- **Observable behavior change.** Programs that relied on per-import
  re-execution of side-effecting modules will see one execution
  instead. Programs that worked around the main-script-relative
  resolver by placing submodule peers next to the entry point can now
  colocate them with their importer. The dict shape, member names, and
  binding semantics are unchanged. This is the runtime prerequisite
  for the package design (docs/PACKAGE_DESIGN.md) and is documented in
  SPEC.md — Modules.

### Runtime — small perf wins (issue #174)

- **Compiler dedups `OP_LINE` per basic block.** The compiler stamped a
  fresh `OP_LINE` for every AST node, so `total is total + i` emitted
  three back-to-back updates to the same line. Now `emit_line` skips
  the write when the line hasn't moved, resetting at every basic-block
  boundary (jump targets, loop tops, after `OP_CALL`/`OP_DISPATCH`, fn
  entry) so the runtime `current_line` invariant never weakens. Bench:
  `while 100k` 6.45 → 6.05 ms (~6% n=5 median, T3200).
- **String concat allocates once.** `OP_ADD`'s string path went
  `malloc → make_str (strdup) → free` — two allocations and a copy per
  `+`. Now it `xmalloc`s the joined buffer directly and hands it to
  `make_str_owned`. Bench: `strcat 2k` 9.6 → 8.79 ms (~8% n=5 median).
- **`ITER_NEXT` buffer fast path skips the `make_num` round-trip.**
  When the for-loop's iterable is a buffer (homogeneous doubles), the
  yielded element now flows through the stack as an immediate-num slot
  via `vm_push_slot(slot_from_num(...))` instead of allocating a fresh
  `VAL_NUM` per iteration. Bench: `for in range of 50000` 25.1 → 22.1
  ms (~12% n=5 median, T3200). The list-iterable path is unchanged.

### Runtime — closure-cycle collector

- **The env↔fn closure-cycle leak is fixed** (docs/CLOSURE_CYCLE_GC.md).
  Escaping closures — `define inner ... return inner`, counters,
  per-iteration handler closures, method dicts — are now reclaimed, both
  mid-run (registry-threshold collections triggered at closure-capture
  time, zero cost on the dispatch hot paths) and at exit. A
  100k-iteration closure-churn loop runs ~40% faster with peak RSS down
  from ~124 MB to ~4 MB; long-running programs that build closures over
  time no longer grow without bound.
- **`Env` lifetime is an honest refcount.** `env_refcount` now counts
  every owner: the creating frame or C caller, closures, child envs (the
  `parent` link is an owned edge), and a chunk's parked recycled call
  env. `env_free`'s captured-gated semantics are replaced by plain
  `env_incref`/`env_decref`; loop-scope envs move the frame's ref
  explicitly. This also fixes latent leaks on early `return` from inside
  a loop scope and makes the env-recycling parent compare
  dangling-pointer-free.
- **Exit teardown reclaims global-scope value cycles** too (e.g. a list
  appended to itself), via a pinned snapshot of global bindings before
  the final collection. `import` module envs are released when the last
  closure defined in them dies (previously leaked unconditionally).
- The collector is conservative by construction: roots are derived from
  refcounts (any uncounted holder makes a node a root), and an
  accounting mismatch aborts the collection — the failure mode is a
  leak, never a use-after-free. Disabled once `spawn` goes
  multithreaded; spawned programs keep the previous behavior.
- Suite: `tests/test_closure_cycles.eigs` (now 17 checks, incl. dict-
  routed cycles and 500 discarded counters) is gated **strictly**
  leak-clean under ASan — section [87] no longer tolerates a
  LeakSanitizer exit. The suite-wide tolerated-leak tally drops 28 → 13;
  every remaining report is byte-identical to the pre-collector
  baseline (spawn-thread programs + pre-existing non-closure shapes).

### Distribution — macOS release binaries, checksums, stability contract

- The Release workflow now builds and publishes macOS binaries —
  `eigenscript-macos-x86_64` (Intel, JIT enabled) and
  `eigenscript-macos-arm64` (Apple Silicon, interpreter-only until the
  ARM64 JIT exists) — alongside the Linux assets, each leg running the
  full suite against the exact binary it uploads. Releases also gain a
  `CHECKSUMS` file (`sha256sum -c` / `shasum -a 256 -c` verifiable).
- The Makefile's hardened link flags (`-z relro`/`-z now`) are now
  Linux-only: macOS's ld64 rejects them, which silently broke every
  Makefile link target on macOS — `make lsp` most visibly. The macOS CI
  leg now compile-checks the LSP so this can't regress unseen.
- README gains a **Stability** section: the executable spec
  (docs/SPEC.md) is the pre-1.0 compatibility surface — patch releases
  never change documented behavior, minor releases may with a CHANGELOG
  entry, and everything outside the spec is explicitly unstable.
- docs/PACKAGE_DESIGN.md: the package/dependency **design proposal**
  (vendored `eigs_modules/`, git-pinned manifest + lockfile, `--pkg`
  tool, install executes nothing). Nothing implemented; open questions
  listed for decision.

## [0.13.0] — 2026-06-12

A language-features release.

### Language — structured errors, stack traces, user modules

- **`throw` preserves the thrown value.** `throw of {"kind": ..., ...}`
  now binds the *dict* (or list, or any value) to the catch variable
  instead of a stringified copy — errors can carry data and be matched
  on fields. Thrown strings and runtime errors bind as strings, exactly
  as before; a runtime error raised while a structured value is in
  flight supersedes it. (`tests/test_trycatch.eigs` 13 → 23 checks.)
- **Uncaught errors print a stack trace**: every frame between the
  failure and the top level, innermost first, with function name and
  line (`at inner (line 6)` / `at <module> (line 9)`), resolved from
  each frame's saved ip via the chunk line tables. Applies to runtime
  errors and uncaught `throw` alike; stderr-only, so program output
  and the error-message contract are unchanged.
- **`import` loads user modules.** When `lib/<name>.eigs` doesn't
  exist, `import name` falls back to `<name>.eigs` resolved relative
  to the script (then the other standard locations) — same namespaced
  dict binding, nothing in global scope. The not-found error now names
  both tried paths. (`tests/test_import.eigs` 12 → 17 checks.)
- docs/SPEC.md: `import` documented for the first time (executed
  examples, stdlib + user module), structured-throw and stack-trace
  sections added; new `examples/errors/uncaught_with_trace.eigs`.

### Tooling — editor support and published docs

- **`editors/vscode/`** — VS Code extension: TextMate grammar (keywords,
  interrogatives, predicates, f-string interpolation, definitions and
  call sites, `|>`/`=>`), comment toggling, bracket/auto-indent rules.
  Symlink into `~/.vscode/extensions/` or package with vsce.
- **`editors/vim/`** — Vim/Neovim syntax + ftdetect for `.eigs`.
- **`.gitattributes`** maps `.eigs` to Python highlighting on github.com
  until a Linguist grammar is upstreamed.
- **Docs site** — `.github/workflows/pages.yml` publishes `docs/` via
  GitHub Pages (Jekyll, relative links resolved; the workflow provisions
  Pages itself on first run). Requires a public repo or paid plan.
- `VERSION` bumped to 0.13.0. Releases: push a `v*` tag **or** dispatch
  the Release workflow — it creates the tag itself (version defaults to
  the VERSION file) and builds in the same run, since environments
  exist that can't push tags and GITHUB_TOKEN-pushed tags don't
  retrigger workflows.
- Doc-example checker runs each example with cwd = its own script dir
  (the macOS Python tempdir is /var/folders/..., not /tmp — examples
  must not assume either).

### Fix — buffer index-assignment kept only the integer part

`b[i] is 1.5` stored `1.0` while `buf_set of [b, i, 1.5]` stored `1.5`:
all four interpreter INDEX_SET arms carried an `(int)` cast on the
stored value, and the JIT's inline buffer store round-tripped through
`cvttsd2si`/`cvtsi2sd` — even though `buffer.data` is `double*` and
nothing documents truncation. Found while writing the executable spec
(its buffer example produced the wrong output). Index-assignment now
stores the full double in the interpreter and the JIT alike, agreeing
with `buf_set`. Regression checks in `test_builtin_indirect.eigs`
(fraction kept, agrees with buf_set, negative fractions) and
`test_jit_paths.eigs` (fractional stores through the hot inline path).

### Docs — executable spec, comparison guide, error corpus

The "AI-legibility" round: documentation a human or a model can trust
because the suite executes it.

- **`docs/SPEC.md`** — canonical spec: every construct with a runnable
  example and its exact output. 38 example/output pairs are executed by
  the new `tests/test_doc_examples.py` (suite section [89]) and must
  match byte-for-byte, so the spec cannot drift from the
  implementation.
- **`docs/COMPARISON.md`** — EigenScript next to Python/JS/Rust/Lisp
  with a porting checklist and before/after transformations; the
  EigenScript halves are suite-verified the same way (11 pairs).
- **`examples/errors/`** — nine programs that fail on purpose, each
  declaring its expected message in an `# expect-error:` header,
  enforced by `tests/test_error_examples.sh` (section [90]).
- **`docs/README.md`** — documentation map; README points at it and at
  the spec.

### LSP — parse-error diagnostics now actually appear

The language server advertised `publishDiagnostics` but never sent a
non-empty one: `send_diagnostics` gated on `g_error_msg`, which the
parser/lexer never populate on a syntax error (they only print to
stderr). So the editor's headline feature — red squiggles on bad
syntax — was dead. The lexer/parser now record the first syntax error
of each tokenize+parse pass (line + message) via a new additive
`eigs_record_first_error` hook — reset at the top of `tokenize()`,
captured at the common sites (unexpected character, unterminated
string, indentation mismatch, `expected X got Y`) — and the LSP turns
it into a diagnostic at the correct 0-based line. The CLI's stderr
output is byte-for-byte unchanged (the capture is purely additive).
New `tests/test_lsp.py` / `test_lsp.sh` (suite section [88], 23 checks)
drive the server over real Content-Length-framed JSON-RPC and assert
initialize capabilities, the now-working diagnostics (clean → none;
syntax errors → right line + message; `didChange` clears them),
completion, hover, definition, references, and `shutdown`/`exit` — the
LSP was previously only compile-checked.

### Closure-cycle leak — investigated; scoped as a reviewed project

A captured `Env` and the closure bound within it form a refcount cycle
the runtime can't reclaim. Confirmed it **accumulates** (~12
allocations per escaping closure; 500 → ~6,000 leaked), correcting
earlier text that implied a bounded exit-time blip. Investigated all
three fix options and recorded why none is a safe drive-by patch
(`docs/CLOSURE_CYCLE_GC.md`): weak self-binding either way introduces
use-after-free (non-escaping recursion / escaping returns), and a
collector is blocked by `Env` having no uniform refcount (trial
deletion) or needing intrusive all-objects registries plus complete
root enumeration (mark-sweep) — a change whose failure mode is memory
corruption, so it belongs in a dedicated reviewed effort, not here.
`tests/test_closure_cycles.eigs` (section [87], 14 checks) pins the
functional correctness of every cycle shape and the non-leaking
invariants (self-referential containers, non-escaping recursion stay
clean) so a regression toward UAF or a wider leak is caught. The
re-examined "dead code" candidates (`tok_type_name`, uncalled `env_*`
helpers, unreachable lint rules) are defensive or public-header API —
left in place rather than churned to game a coverage number.

### Testing & CI — coverage-gap closure

A gcov pass over the suite (`docs/TEST_COVERAGE_ANALYSIS.md`) drove a
round of test, runner, build, and runtime fixes:

- **Lambda closures no longer leak their defining env.** `OP_CLOSURE`
  bumped `env_refcount` *and* `make_fn` took the fn's own ref — the
  extra count had no owner, so a call env that created any closure
  could never drop to zero. A fn returned as a lambda (no self-binding)
  now frees its env when the last fn ref dies. The remaining known leak
  is the env↔fn cycle of `define`-bound closures (`define inner` lives
  *in* the env that `inner` captures) — refcounting alone cannot
  reclaim it; the suite runner tolerates LeakSanitizer-only nonzero
  exits and tallies them in the final summary.
- **Suite sections gate on exit codes** (`rc_ok` / `check_eigs_suite`
  in `run_all_tests.sh`): a crash after correct output now fails the
  section instead of slipping past the marker grep (previously only
  check [71] asserted rc).
- **Wired in orphaned tests**: `test_fmt.sh` (14 checks) and
  `test_lint.sh` (10, plus a cwd-bitrot fix) — fmt.c/lint.c were at 0%
  line coverage; 28 orphaned `.eigs` suites ([85]); compound
  dot-assignment (`d.k += v`, `items[i].f += v`) which had zero
  coverage of its clone_ast desugaring.
- **New suites**: `test_jit_paths.eigs` ([82], checksummed coverage of
  the Stage-5 fused opcodes, inline-IC slow paths, OSR, and JIT
  helpers, with an EIGS_JIT_STATS gate so it can't silently pass
  interpreted), `test_walker_matrix.eigs` ([83], closure capture per
  AST node kind — the #156 bug class), `test_builtin_indirect.eigs`
  ([84], lowered-opcode vs C-builtin agreement for `dispatch` and the
  bench-only buffer builtins).
- **CI**: new `extensions` job builds `make http` and runs the suite
  against it (the probe-gated HTTP/model sections never executed in CI
  before), compile-checks `make gfx` and the LSP, and runs
  `make jit-smoke`.
- **`make lsp` fixed**: the hand-picked source list predated the
  bytecode VM (80 unresolved symbols); it now links the full runtime
  minus `main.c`, with the missing `g_exe_dir` / `g_load_env`
  definitions added to `eigenlsp.c`.
- `make_fn` dropped its dead `body`/`body_count` params (AST bodies
  died with the tree-walking evaluator); `clone_ast` survives as the
  parser-internal compound-dot-assign desugar helper.

Round 2 (residual gaps from `docs/TEST_COVERAGE_ANALYSIS.md`):

- **`make fuzz` fixed** — same bitrot as the LSP: FUZZ_SOURCES predated
  the bytecode VM and the harness called the deleted `eval_node`. It
  now links the full runtime minus main.c and drives tokenize → parse
  → compile_ast → vm_execute; 44 curated adversarial cases run under
  ASan in the `extensions` CI job on every push.
- **ext_db executes in CI** — new `database` job: postgres:16 service
  container, `make full`, suite with `DATABASE_URL`. `test_db.eigs`
  gained a live-connection-gated table round-trip (DB09–DB15:
  CREATE / parameterized INSERT / COUNT / parameterized SELECT /
  multi-row `db_query_json` / malformed-SQL error).
- **New suites/checks**: `test_corpus.eigs` ([86], 25 checks —
  `build_corpus` + the `tok_base_string` detokenizer table, both 0%
  before; lexer.c 71→92%), ext_store list-valued fields +
  corrupt-header rejects (`store_json_parse_array` was 0%;
  test_store 14→22), JSON escape branches JH32–JH43 (`\n \r \t \/ \\`
  + multi-byte `\uXXXX`, only ASCII `\u` ran before), lint
  fn-def-shadow / fn-unreachable / feature-rich-clean-walk
  (lint.c 50→81%), and hot interrogated/captured-name assignment in
  `test_jit_paths.eigs` (`jit_helper_set_fn_name_local`, the last 0%
  JIT helper, → 69%).
- Findings for future cleanup: the lint empty-block and
  is-in-condition rules are unreachable (parser rejects those inputs
  first), and eigenscript.c's residual ~25% is mostly `tok_type_name`
  plus legacy env API variants the VM no longer calls.
- Suite: 1704 checks (release + ASan; 27 tallied closure-cycle
  leak-exits), 1766 on the full build with live postgres.

### Fixes

- **#159 — `proc_read_buf` for binary-safe child stdout; `proc_read_line`
  / `proc_write` return partials instead of dropping them.** Three
  related robustness fixes in the 0.13.0 streaming-subprocess surface:
  - `proc_read` reads into a heap buffer, writes a trailing NUL, and
    returns a `VAL_STR` — an embedded NUL in the child's output
    silently truncated the result at the first one. The natural use
    of `proc_read` (as opposed to `_line`) is bulk/binary output,
    where NUL is just a byte. New `proc_read_buf of [fd, max]`
    mirrors `read_bytes_buf`: returns a `VAL_BUFFER` so every byte
    survives, indexable like any buffer; `null` on EOF; same 10 MB
    cap. `proc_read` is now documented as text-only.
  - `proc_read_line` returned `null` when a mid-stream `read(2)`
    failed, dropping any partial line already buffered. The
    documented contract reserves `null` for "EOF with empty buffer";
    a partial-then-error now returns the partial (mirrors the
    EOF-with-partial path just below).
  - `proc_write` returned `-1` after a **partial** write hit an error
    (e.g. EPIPE mid-stream). Within the contract, but a caller that
    retries on `-1` then double-sends the delivered prefix. Now
    returns the partial byte count; `-1` is reserved for the
    nothing-was-written case (like `write(2)` itself).
  Regression in `tests/test_proc_stream.eigs` (30 → 39 checks):
  `printf %b` with an embedded `\0` round-trips through
  `proc_read_buf` byte-for-byte (15a–15f), `proc_read` still
  NUL-truncates (16a), and `proc_read_buf` returns `null` on EOF
  (17a, 17b).
- **#158 — defaults fire for every unsupplied defaulted slot, regardless
  of `argc`.** The OP_CALL binding logic in `src/vm.c` gated the
  null-placeholder bind-then-OP_DEFAULT_PARAM tail on `(argc >=
  first_default) && (argc < param_count)`. That meant an underfed call
  *below* `first_default` skipped the entire defaulted tail — on
  `define f(a, b, c is 1)`, `f of 5` bound `a=5, b=null, c=null`
  instead of `a=5, b=null, c=1`. The DISPATCH path (single-arg method
  call) had the analog: the `first_default <= 1` gate left slot 1+
  unbound whenever `first_default > 1`. Fix: drop the lower-bound `argc
  >= first_default` requirement at both `src/vm.c` binding sites and
  the OP_DISPATCH path. Tail slots `[argc, param_count)` always get a
  null placeholder when the chunk has defaults; OP_DEFAULT_PARAM then
  fills the defaulted ones (non-defaulted underfed slots stay null,
  matching the no-default underfed semantics). The #154 contract
  callout that documented the now-fixed argc<first_default subtlety is
  rewritten — the docs and behavior now agree. Regression in
  `tests/test_default_params.eigs` (+7 checks 9a–9g: underfed-mid,
  underfed-empty, two-default-trailing combinations) and
  `tests/test_call_semantics.eigs` (the `mpd2 of []` shape flipped to
  `[null, 100]`; added `mpd3` underfed scalar/empty checks).
- **#157 — destructure pattern parser: specific errors, no silent fallthrough.**
  The 0.13.0 destructuring lookahead in `src/parser.c` filled a fixed
  `names_tmp[64]` buffer and silently `p->pos = saved`-restored the
  position on any mismatch (>64 names, trailing comma, non-ident
  target). The user then hit whatever the list-literal expression
  parser said about the same tokens — usually "1 parse error(s)" with
  no hint that they'd written something close to a destructure.
  Fix: before consuming, bracket-count the lookahead to find the
  matching `]` and check if the following token is `is`. If so, commit
  to destructure parsing and emit pattern-specific errors:
  - `[a, b,] is rhs` → "trailing comma in destructuring pattern"
  - `[a[0], b] is rhs` / `[a.x, b] is rhs` → "destructuring pattern
    requires identifiers (index/field targets like a[0] or a.x are not
    supported)"
  - 65+ name pattern → "destructuring pattern exceeds 64 names"
  List-literal expression statements that don't end in `] is` still
  parse normally (the scan returns "not a destructure"). Regression in
  `tests/run_all_tests.sh` (slot [16/16] Error Messages, +3 checks
  EM21/EM22/EM23).
- **#154 — docs: unflagged semantic change `g of []` on multi-param fn.**
  0.13.0's default-params commit lowered `f of []` to an argc=0 call
  so an all-default function can be called with no args. The single-
  param non-defaulted case was preserved by a compile-time special
  case (`one of []` still binds the param to the empty list), but
  multi-param functions silently changed: `g of []` on
  `define g(a, b)` now binds `a=null, b=null` (was `a=[], b=null` in
  0.12.0). The new behavior is the cleaner reading of the contract
  ("missing parameters are `null`"), but it's still an observable
  shift that wasn't flagged. Fix: LANGUAGE_CONTRACT.md default-params
  section now spells out the change, including the subtle case that
  defaulted multi-param fns *also* get all-null (because defaults fire
  only when `argc >= first_default`, and argc=0 < 1 = first_default).
  A grep of the suite and Tidepool turned up no multi-param-takes-
  empty-list call sites, so no code change needed. Regression in
  `tests/test_call_semantics.eigs` (12 → 16): pin down the multi-param
  `[null, null]` shape, the 1-param-preserves-empty-list shape, the
  defaulted-1-param fires its default, and the defaulted-multi-param
  all-null (argc<first_default) edge.
- **#153 — docs: contract spells out the `f of [x]` non-spread rule.**
  `docs/LANGUAGE_CONTRACT.md` previously promised "if `f` has two or
  more parameters and `X` is a list, the elements are spread", which
  read like a length-agnostic rule. The compiler only spreads literal
  lists at `count > 1` (`src/compiler.c` call lowering), so `f of [x]`
  always binds the one-element list as a single argument regardless of
  callee arity. With 0.13.0 default parameters, "call a defaulted
  multi-param fn with one arg" became a mainstream pattern and started
  hitting this surprise — notably the recursive form `fib of [n - 1]`
  the moment you add a defaulted `memo`. Fix: the call-spread section
  now states "literal list of length ≥ 2 spreads; length-1 binds the
  whole list", and the default-params section calls out the footgun
  with the `fib` example and the `f of (x)` paren-form workaround.
  Behavior unchanged; this is a docs-only sharpening. Regression in
  `tests/test_call_semantics.eigs` (8 → 12 checks): pin down the
  multi-param + 1-elem-list, paren-form spread, default-fires-with-paren,
  and `fib of (n - 1)` recursion shape.
- **#152 — `audio_play_loop` hard caps loops + clip-aware byte budget.**
  `builtin_audio_play_loop` cast its `double` loops argument to `int`
  without bounds-checking; NaN, `+inf`, or any value above `INT_MAX` was
  undefined behavior, and even a well-formed huge `int` (or a modest
  count over a multi-second clip) would queue gigabytes into SDL's audio
  ring in a single call. `SDL_QueueAudio` copies the buffer each time,
  so one bad call could OOM the process or stall it in a copy loop. Fix:
  reject NaN and any value outside `[1, 10000]` before the cast (hard
  ceiling, documented in CLAUDE.md), and additionally reject any call
  whose total queued bytes would exceed a 256 MiB budget
  (`loops * samples * sizeof(int16_t)`). A 5-second 44100Hz clip caps
  at ~593 loops; the typical short-clip case (a few hundred ms) still
  hits the 10000-loop ceiling. Regression in `tests/test_audio.eigs`
  (slot [62], 20 → 24): covers `loops>10000`, `1e20` (cast UB sentinel),
  byte-budget rejection on a 5s clip, and `loops=10000` at the ceiling
  still succeeding.
- **#151 — `recv_timeout` clamps `ms` before the `(long)` cast.**
  `builtin_recv_timeout` cast a `double` ms argument directly to `long`
  when computing the deadline; NaN, `+inf`, or any value above `LONG_MAX`
  is undefined behavior in C and in practice produced a garbage deadline
  that fired immediately (spurious instant timeout) or waited
  essentially forever. Fix: sanitize `ms` first — NaN degenerates to 0
  (try_recv), negatives degenerate to 0, anything above ~one year of
  ms (3.15e10) clamps to that ceiling, which keeps the integer
  arithmetic well below `LONG_MAX` on every supported `time_t`.
  Related hardening: channel condvars now use `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` via
  `pthread_condattr_setclock`, so `recv_timeout`'s deadline is immune
  to wall-clock steps (NTP, `settimeofday`). Matches `exec_capture`'s
  monotonic discipline. Regression in `tests/test_channel_nb.eigs`
  (slot [77], 22 → 29).
- **#148 — replay boundary for subprocess and concurrency builtins.**
  Ten builtins sit on the wrong side of `EIGS_REPLAY`'s replay-by-tape
  contract: `proc_spawn`, `proc_write`, `proc_read_line`, `proc_read`,
  `proc_close`, `proc_wait`, `exec_capture`, `recv`, `try_recv`,
  `recv_timeout`. Their return values do not pin down the host-side
  causal structure (child PIDs, fd numbers, kernel scheduling), so
  replaying them — even with `TRACE_NONDET_TAKE` — would let a recorded
  script re-execute real side effects against a tape that cannot
  re-create the world it ran in (verified: replaying a proc program
  forked real children). Fix: each of the ten builtins now checks
  `g_replay_enabled` first and raises a catchable runtime error
  (`"<fn>: not replayable under EIGS_REPLAY (subprocess/concurrency
  boundary; see docs/TRACE.md)"`). Boundary is documented in a new
  "Non-Replayable Builtins" section of `docs/TRACE.md`. Regression in
  `tests/test_replay.sh` (two new cases).
- **#149 — `FD_CLOEXEC` on `proc_spawn` and `exec_capture` pipe fds.**
  The four pipe ends in `proc_spawn` (`in_pipe[0/1]`, `out_pipe[0/1]`)
  and the two in `exec_capture` (`pipefd[0/1]`) were left without
  `FD_CLOEXEC` after `pipe(2)`, so a subsequent `proc_spawn` /
  `exec_capture` child inherited the parent-side fds of every prior
  spawn — a long-running interpreter accumulating live procs would leak
  growing fd tables into each new child. Fix: `fcntl(F_SETFD,
  FD_CLOEXEC)` on every pipe end right after `pipe()`. The child's
  `dup2` into `STDIN_FILENO`/`STDOUT_FILENO` clears `FD_CLOEXEC` on the
  destination, so the child's own stdio still survives `execvp`.
  Regression in `tests/test_proc_stream.eigs` (case 13: spawn cat, then
  `exec_capture` a `sh -c` checker that asserts the pipe fds are absent
  from the new child's `/proc/self/fd`).
- **#150 — `exec_capture` child resets `SIGPIPE` to `SIG_DFL`.**
  `proc_spawn` installs a process-wide `SIGPIPE = SIG_IGN` once (so
  the EigenScript parent gets `EPIPE` on write instead of dying), and
  that disposition survives `fork`. After at least one `proc_spawn`,
  every `exec_capture` child inherits `SIG_IGN`, so any subprocess
  pipeline that relies on `SIGPIPE` to drain (`yes | head -1`,
  `cat | head`, GNU `tar | cmd`) hangs — the upstream producer fills
  its pipe buffer instead of dying when the downstream reader exits.
  Fix: `signal(SIGPIPE, SIG_DFL)` in the `exec_capture` child block
  between `fork` and `execvp`, mirroring `proc_spawn`. Regression in
  `tests/test_proc_stream.eigs` (case 14: `yes | head -n 1` under
  `exec_capture` with a 5s timeout — passes promptly when SIGPIPE is
  reset, would hit the timeout otherwise).
- **#155 — `frame->call_argc` initialized on `vm_run`'s base frame.**
  Every entry path that runs a user function through `vm_execute`
  (`spawn`, `sort_by` / tensor gradient callbacks via `call_eigs_fn`,
  `dispatch`, HTTP handlers, module-level) leaves the base frame's
  `call_argc` reading whatever stale value the last occupant of that
  depth left behind — or zero on a fresh thread. `OP_DEFAULT_PARAM`
  compared against that garbage, so a 0.13.0 default could fire over
  a slot the caller did supply. Most reproducible on a fresh thread:
  `spawn of [worker(a, b is 100), 1, 2]` was returning 101 instead of
  3. Fix: set `frame->call_argc = chunk->param_count` in the base-frame
  init — the C caller has already bound every param, so no default
  should re-fire. Regression in `tests/test_default_params.eigs`
  (slot [72], 16 → 21).
- **#156 — AST pre-pass walkers handle `AST_SLICE` and
  `AST_LIST_PATTERN_ASSIGN`.** All five compiler walkers
  (`collect_referenced_names`, `collect_referenced_names_skip`,
  `scan_for_captures`, `scan_for_interrogated`,
  `collect_module_names_walk`) fell through `default: break` on the
  two 0.13.0 node types, so a closure that touched an outer local
  only through a slice (`data[1:3]`) or a destructure RHS
  (`[m, n] is pair`) slot-promoted the outer and read `null`, and a
  module-level destructure (`[gx, gy] is [100, 200]`) was invisible
  to module-name collection so writes inside functions silently
  created locals instead of updating the globals. Fix: register
  destructure target names and recurse into RHS / slice
  (target, start, end) in every walker. Regressions in
  `tests/test_slicing.eigs` (slot [76], 46 → 48) and
  `tests/test_destructuring.eigs` (slot [74], 26 → 28).

### Audio — `audio_play_loop` (finite-count loop playback)

`audio_play_loop of [samples, loops]` queues a sample list `loops`
times in a single call (finite, `loops >= 1`). Saves N round-trips
through the workaround pattern of polling `audio_queue_size` each
frame to refill an ambient loop. Returns total samples queued
(`len of samples * loops`), or `0` on bad args / closed device.

`loops == -1` (continuous infinite loop) is intentionally rejected
for now — that needs a background refill mechanism and is a
separate ship. The proper way to choose between the two: pick
`audio_play_loop` for any finite repetition (game ambient that
plays N times, sound cue repeated, music loop that ends with the
level); pick the existing poll-and-refill workaround for genuinely
infinite cases until the infinite variant lands.

Wire-up: new `builtin_audio_play_loop` in `src/ext_gfx.c` next to
`builtin_audio_play`, registered alongside it. Single int16
conversion pass, then N `SDL_QueueAudio` calls with the same
buffer — keeps memory flat regardless of `loops` count (vs. a
single-call `n * loops` allocation that would balloon for long
clips).

Test: 6 new checks appended to `tests/test_audio.eigs` (suite slot
[62], 14 → 20), gated on a successful `audio_open` so the
non-gfx builds and headless-CI machines fall through to skip-asserts.
SDL2's `dummy` audio driver is enough to exercise the success path
locally (`SDL_AUDIODRIVER=dummy`). Closes Tidepool `GAPS.md`
GAP-002 finite-count form.

Note also: GAP-001 (`audio_sweep`) was already shipped (predates
this cycle); Tidepool's GAPS.md just hadn't been updated.

### Language — `spawn` with multiple args

`spawn of [fn, arg1, arg2, ...]` now passes N positional arguments
to the spawned function, not just one. Bare `spawn of fn` (no args)
and the existing `spawn of [fn, arg]` (one arg) keep working
verbatim. Missing trailing params bind to `null`; extra args are
ignored — same arity-tolerant stance EigenScript already uses for
regular calls. Args are shared by reference, not deep-copied,
matching the channel model already in place (`docs/BUILTINS.md`
thread-safety note: mutable containers shouldn't be mutated
concurrently from both sides; transfer ownership or send immutable
values).

Wire-up: `ThreadHandle` swaps its single `fn_arg: Value*` slot for
`fn_args: Value**` + `fn_arg_count: int`; `builtin_spawn` incref's
every list element 1..N (element 0 is the fn) into a heap-allocated
arg array; `thread_entry` binds `args[0..bind_n)` to params via
`env_set_local`, then fills the remaining params with `null` via
`env_set_local_owned`; `builtin_thread_join` decref's every arg
and frees the array on cleanup. For `VAL_BUILTIN` callees the
1-arg path stays `fn(args[0])` (zero churn for existing one-shots
like `spawn of [my_builtin, x]`); 0-arg becomes `fn(null)`; N-arg
packs into a list to match how EigenScript surfaces multi-arg
calls to builtins everywhere else.

Test: `tests/test_spawn_args.eigs` (22 checks across 0/1/2/3-arg
forms, underfill / overfill, heterogeneous types, concurrent
spawns with no cross-talk, shared-by-ref semantics, closure capture
+ extra args, and the non-function-first-arg error path; suite slot
[78]). Fix for Tidepool `GAPS.md` GAP-006.

### Language — non-blocking channel recv (`recv_timeout`)

`recv_timeout of [channel, ms]` joins `try_recv` as the second
non-blocking option for game loops, UI threads, and any caller that
can't afford `recv`'s unbounded park. Returns the value if one
arrives — or is already buffered — before the deadline; returns
`null` on timeout or on close-while-waiting. Fractional `ms` is
honored (ns precision via `pthread_cond_timedwait` on
`CLOCK_REALTIME`); negative `ms` degenerates to a `try_recv`.

Wire-up: new `builtin_recv_timeout` in `src/builtins.c` next to
`builtin_recv` / `builtin_try_recv`, registered alongside them in the
builtins env. Deadline is computed by adding `ms` to a
`clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, ...)` snapshot, then the existing
`while (count == 0 && !closed && rc == 0)` drain pattern uses
`pthread_cond_timedwait` instead of `pthread_cond_wait` — so it
honors spurious wakeups, close broadcasts (channel's
`pthread_cond_broadcast(&not_empty)` already wakes the waiter), and
the deadline uniformly. No new state on the `Channel` struct.

`try_recv` was already shipped earlier but had zero suite coverage;
the new `tests/test_channel_nb.eigs` closes that hole alongside the
`recv_timeout` paths (22 checks across empty / buffered / FIFO /
post-close drain / negative-ms degeneration / cross-thread arrival /
close-while-waiting / error paths; suite slot [77]). Fix for
Tidepool `GAPS.md` GAP-005.

### Language — slicing

`a[start:end]` is now a real expression form, half-open, with `[:]`,
`[start:]`, `[:end]`, and `[:]` defaults and negative bounds resolved
against length first. Applies to lists, strings, and buffers — the
same three sequence types that accept `a[i]`. The slice is always an
**independent copy**: mutating `b = a[1:4]; b[0] is 999` leaves `a`
untouched, matching the same "values, not views" stance used by the
rest of the language.

Bounds-check is strict, not clamping: `0 <= start <= end <= len`
(note `<=` on the upper end, since positions sit between elements —
`a[len:]` is a legal empty slice but `a[len]` raises). Too-positive
upper bounds, inverted ranges (`a[3:1]`), too-negative starts
(`a[-99:]`), and non-integer / non-sequence operands all raise, same
philosophy as single indexing — same surfacing of sloppy arithmetic
that 0.13.0 already does for `a[2.9999998]`.

Wire-up: new AST node `AST_SLICE { target, start, end }` (NULL bound
= omitted = default), new opcode `OP_SLICE_GET` (pops 3, pushes 1).
Parser factors a `parse_subscript_suffix` helper out of the seven
inline `[...]` postfix sites in `parser.c` so list-vs-slice
disambiguation happens in one place; statement-level destructuring
(`[a, b] is rhs`) is unaffected because that lookahead runs only
when `[` opens a fresh statement. JIT scanner needs no change — its
default-else stops on any unknown opcode, so a new bytecode just
falls back to the interpreter for now. Test:
`tests/test_slicing.eigs` (46 checks across 18 sections, suite slot
[76]).

### Language — streaming subprocess I/O

Six new builtins for talking to a child process over time, sibling to
`exec_capture`'s all-at-once form. `proc_spawn of [argv...]` returns
`[pid, in_fd, out_fd]` (or `[-1,-1,-1]` on failure) for a fork+execvp
child with stdin/stdout connected to anonymous pipes; `proc_write`,
`proc_read_line`, and `proc_read` move bytes through those pipes with
raw `read(2)`/`write(2)` (no parent-side stdio buffering — line
streaming relies on the child not block-buffering its stdout, hence
the `stdbuf -oL` note in the contract); `proc_close` is an idempotent
`close(2)`; `proc_wait` blocks on `waitpid` and returns the exit code
(or `128+sig` if killed by a signal).

SIGPIPE is set to `SIG_IGN` process-wide on first spawn so a writing
parent gets `EPIPE` from `proc_write` instead of dying; the child
resets SIGPIPE to `SIG_DFL` post-fork so it keeps conventional Unix
broken-pipe semantics. No GC integration on the handle for v1:
callers explicitly `proc_close` both fds and `proc_wait` the pid.
Test: `tests/test_proc_stream.eigs` (25 checks, suite slot [75]).

### Language — destructuring assignment

`[a, b, c] is rhs` evaluates `rhs` once, requires it to be a list of
exactly 3 elements, and binds the three names. Length mismatch and
non-list RHS both raise; matches the strict bounds-check stance the
language already uses for indexing. Swap is the natural consequence:
`[a, b] is [b, a]` builds the RHS list first, so both reads happen
before either write.

Wire-up: AST `AST_LIST_PATTERN_ASSIGN { names[], name_hashes[],
expr }`; new opcode `OP_DESTRUCTURE_UNPACK <n:u16>` that pops a list,
validates length, then pushes elements in reverse so element 0 ends
up at TOS. Compiler factors the per-name OBSERVE+SET emission out of
AST_ASSIGN into a reusable `emit_assign_for_tos` helper (same slot/
captured/global resolution rules) and the destructure case calls it
N times with `OP_POP` between each to expose the next element.
Parser recognises `[ IDENT (, IDENT)* ] is` at statement start via
lookahead with save/restore, so list-literal expressions still parse
as expressions. V1 supports plain identifier targets only — nested
patterns, index/field targets, and rest patterns are deliberately
deferred. Test: `tests/test_destructuring.eigs` (26 checks, suite
slot [74]).

### Language — negative indexing

`a[-1]` is now the last element of `a`, `a[-2]` the second-to-last,
through `a[-len of a]` which is the first. Applies uniformly to
lists, strings, and buffers (the three sequence types `a[i]` accepts
today). Resolution is `i + len` *before* the bounds check, so the
valid input range becomes `[-len, len)`; too-negative indices raise
the same out-of-range error as too-positive ones. Error messages
report the original user-written index (`a[-99]` on len 5 raises
"index -99 out of range" — not the post-resolution value).

Wire-up: new `vm_index_resolve(&i, len)` helper in vm.c sits between
`vm_index_is_int` and the bounds check; all 14 index sites
(OP_INDEX_GET / OP_INDEX_SET / jit_helper_index_get /
jit_helper_index_set, slot fast paths and slow paths, list+string+
buffer arms) route through it. JIT inline INDEX_SET buffer fast path
needs no change: its unsigned-compare bounds-check already bails to
the helper on negative indices, and the helper now resolves them.
Test: `tests/test_negative_index.eigs` (19 checks including
JIT-loop coverage, suite slot [73]).

### Language — default parameter values

`define f(a, b is expr) as: ...` — trailing parameters can carry
default expressions. When the caller omits an argument the default
is evaluated *at call time* against the live environment + the
already-bound earlier parameters, so defaults can reference earlier
params (`define pair(a, b is a * 2)`) and capture an outer name
freshly per call (`define scale(x, k is multiplier)` re-reads
`multiplier`). Defaults are trailing-only — a required parameter
after a defaulted one is a parse error.

Explicit `null` is a real argument and **does not** trigger the
default. To call with zero args on a single-parameter function,
pass the empty list literal: `f of []` lowers to an argc=0 call.
Lambdas (`->` arrows, `lambda` blocks) do not accept defaults.

Wire-up: AST `func` gains `param_defaults[]` + `first_default`;
`EigsChunk` gains `first_default`; new opcode
`OP_DEFAULT_PARAM [slot:16][skip_off:16]` runs at function entry
and jumps over the per-slot default-eval prologue when
`frame->call_argc > slot`. The interpreter and the JIT helper-call
path bind null placeholders for `[argc..param_count)` so the
default prologue is reachable. Per-chunk env recycling is
unaffected — its `argc < param_count` reject already routes
defaulted calls through `env_new`. Test:
`tests/test_default_params.eigs` (16 checks, wired as suite slot
[72]).

## [0.12.0] — 2026-06-10

A JIT performance release. Stage 5 (a–i) lands the inline fast-path
matrix — INDEX_SET, EnvIC name get/set, dict-dot via 2-way inline
cache, tracked-num arith/compare operands, native VAL_FN calls inside
thunks, per-loop OSR slots, DOT_SET in-place writes, and per-chunk
call-env recycling. Stage 4v/4w/4x close the bailout coverage chain so
INDEX_SET, LOOP_STALL_CHECK, and SET-name opcodes all compile into
thunks. Compile-gating the temporal history removes the always-on
reversibility tax from non-temporal programs. Cumulative on
bench_dmg_shape: 239 → ~116 ms (2.06×); the JIT now beats
`EIGS_JIT_OFF` by ~45% on it, and cpu_instrs runs at ~5 MHz (target
was 4.19).

### Performance — Stage 5i: per-chunk call-env recycling

A function chunk's env layout is fixed (same param names → same slots
→ same hashes), so a dead call env can be parked on its chunk and the
next call rebinds the param slots in place — no env_new, no per-param
env_hash_insert, no binding_version bump, which also keeps every EnvIC
aimed at the env valid across calls. On bench_dmg_shape, env_new
dropped 500k → 9 per run.

Park gates (any failure falls back to env_free, which keeps its own
freelist): single-threaded only (chunks are shared across spawn
threads); never a loop-scope child env (frame->env must equal
fn_env); not captured by a closure; count must equal the
compiler-known layout — a binding created mid-call (e.g. a new
SET_NAME_LOCAL name, `__loop_exit__`) must NOT resolve in the next
invocation, and an underfed call leaves params unhashed; every param
slot must be name-bound (a single-arg OP_DISPATCH to a multi-param fn
binds only param 0). Take gates: cache parent matches the callee's
closure env and the call fully binds the params. Parked slots are
dropped to null (no value pinning) with assign_counts cleared.

Numbers: 2M-trivial-call probe 147 → 109 ms (−26%), recursive fib(25)
23.5 → 19.4 ms (−17%), bench_dmg_shape ~118 → ~116 ms (small — the
per-call env work was a thin time slice there despite dominating the
call counts). All four return paths (interpreter RETURN/RETURN_NULL,
jit_helper_return/_null) park; all three call sites (CASE(CALL),
jit_helper_call, CASE(DISPATCH)) take.

### Performance — Stage 5h: DOT_SET immediate fast path + 2-way dict cache

bench_dmg_shape 156 → ~118 ms (−24%); cumulative for the 0.12.0 JIT
work, 239 → 118 ms (2.0×). Both fixes came straight out of the
post-5f/5g profile and help the interpreter as well as the JIT
(EIGS_JIT_OFF dmg: 230 → 213 ms):

- **DOT_SET immediate fast path.** `jit_helper_dot_set` and
  CASE(DOT_SET) now take the `dict_set_cached_immediate` route that
  LOCAL_DOT_SET has had since 0.11: an immediate-num write into an
  exclusive untracked num field mutates `data.num` in place. The old
  path materialized every value through `vm_pop` — 2 `make_num` +
  ~1.5 `free_value` per DMG step on `ctx.cycles is …` / `ctx.pc is …`
  (999k of the profile's 1.0M make_num calls).
- **2-way set-associative dict cache** (64 sets × 2 ways; same 128
  entries). Direct mapping had a pathological mode the DMG register
  file hit dead-on: two hot keys on the SAME dict whose hashes collide
  mod the set count ("pc"/"cycles") evicted each other on every
  access — 500k full hash walks per run through the dot_get helpers.
  Insertion shifts the previous insert to way 0, so an alternating
  pair settles with one key per way; the Stage 5d inline probe checks
  both ways (no swapping) so a settled pair stays settled in native
  code too.

### Performance — JIT Stage 5f/5g: native calls + per-loop OSR slots

bench_dmg_shape 212 → ~156 ms (−27%); the JIT now beats the
interpreter by ~33% on this workload where they were previously near
parity. Two structural fixes and one coverage op:

- **5g — per-loop OSR slots.** Diagnosis: a chunk had ONE OSR slot,
  owned forever by whichever loop crossed the back-edge threshold
  first. bench_dmg_shape's 65k-iteration setup loop pinned it, so the
  500k-iteration main loop ran fully interpreted through every prior
  stage. Chunks now carry `jit_osr[4]` — one slot per hot loop header,
  scanned by the JUMP_BACK handler; failed offsets keep their slot so
  they can't retry-storm.
- **5f — native VAL_FN calls inside thunks.** `jit_helper_call` now
  pushes the callee frame and invokes the callee's own thunk directly
  when one exists, so a fully-native callee (RETURN sentinel) returns
  straight into the caller's thunk — the DMG shape `cyc is handler of
  ctx` no longer forces an interpreted tail every iteration.
  Return-code triage: 0 = completed; 1 = not eligible (uncompiled
  callee / non-callable / frame or native-depth cap — interpreter
  re-executes the CALL untouched); 2 = deep bail — the callee's thunk
  exited mid-prefix (guard bail, nested deep bail, or pending error),
  every frame ip is left consistent, and a new `-2` advance sentinel
  tells vm_run's three thunk sites to resync to the current frame and
  interpret on. Native call depth is capped (64) because each nested
  native call recurses the C stack, unlike the interpreter's flat
  frame array; errors inside a native callee force a prompt deep bail
  so CHECK_ERROR unwinds without running arbitrary native caller code.
- **OP_DOT_SET compiles into thunks** (helper running CASE(DOT_SET)
  verbatim) — it was the last unsupported op in the DMG main loop
  (`ctx.cycles is …` on a GET_NAME'd dict).

### Performance — JIT Stage 5e: tracked-num operands in arith/compare

Fixes the "observed counter permanently bails native code" class found
in 5d validation, with the mechanism now precisely diagnosed: it is
CASE(SET_LOCAL)'s in-place branch — a counter assigned once while
observed (`k is 0` before an `unobserved:` block) becomes a tracked
Value, and every later unobserved `SET_LOCAL` of an immediate mutates
that Value in place, so the env slot stays a tracked pointer forever
and every native arith/compare touching it bailed, every iteration.

- ADD/SUB/MUL/DIV/MOD and all six comparisons now accept heap/tracked
  `VAL_NUM` operands via a shared loader: immediate → as before;
  pointer → tag/type guards, `refcount >= 2` (rc==1 routes to the
  interpreter so its NUM_REUSE in-place branch keeps observer-value
  identity exact), then `data.num` through the pointer.
- Operand stack refs drop at commit: a's slot is captured before the
  result store overwrites it; b's slot memory sits just above the new
  TOS. A branched commit on the OR of both operands' tag bits
  (snapshotted in %r8 before the loaders) keeps the imm/imm path at
  its pre-5e two-instruction cost (~3% residual on pure-immediate
  loops from the snapshot+test, traded for the class win).
- Per-op bail trampolines: each template's many guards share one
  rel32 hop to the epilogue, so the 256-slot patch budget now scales
  to arbitrarily arith-dense chunks.
- The JIT SET_LOCAL template now mirrors the interpreter's in-place
  branch exactly (imm TOS over an exclusive untracked num rewrites
  data.num). This is correctness, not just speed: the swap path would
  free a Value that `g_last_observer` can still point at — the
  interpreter never frees it in this situation precisely because of
  that branch.

Poisoned-counter dict loop 141→105 ms (−26%); bench_idxset 24.6→22.2
ms (−10%, its `fill` counter was poisoned); observed buffer-fill probe
−13%. bench_dmg_shape is now capped by user-fn OP_CALL bails forcing
an interpreted tail every iteration — recorded in ROADMAP.md as the
next JIT item.

### Performance — JIT Stage 5d: inline dict-dot fast paths

`LOCAL_DOT_GET` / `LOCAL_DOT_SET` (the `c.a is c.a + 1` shape — DMG
register access) now inline their hot paths in thunks instead of
paying the helper-call ABI:

- shared probe: fn_env slot is a heap `VAL_DICT`, dict-cache entry
  match (`(h ^ ptr) & mask` with the hash baked at compile time, the
  TLS cache reached via the g_vm tpoff delta), interned-key pointer
  equality;
- GET pushes `v->data.num`'s raw bits when the field is an untracked
  num — that IS the immediate slot encoding, so no refcounts and no
  allocation;
- SET mirrors `dict_set_cached_immediate`: in-place `data.num`
  overwrite when the existing field is an exclusive untracked num and
  TOS is an immediate.

Cache misses, strcmp-equal keys, non-num/observed fields, and non-dict
targets fall back to the Stage 4m/4q-d helpers, which repopulate the
dict cache for the next iteration. New `EigsJitLayout` fields expose
the vm.c-private dict cache (tpoff, entry size/offsets, mask).

Isolated dict-RMW loop (2M iterations, fully unobserved): 65 → 45 ms
(−31%). Suite green, zero JIT bailouts on the benchmarks.

### Found — observer-tracked numbers permanently bail native code

Diagnosed while validating 5d: a variable assigned even once while
observed (e.g. `k is 0` before an `unobserved:` block) is promoted to
a TRACKED-num Value, and the interpreter's NUM_REUSE in-place
arithmetic keeps that same tracked Value alive forever — so every
native arith/compare touching it guard-fails, every iteration. The
thunk enters, bails at the first comparison, and the loop body runs
interpreted. This is the structural cap on `bench_dmg_shape`'s
top-level loop (`steps`, `pc` are tracked) and likely on any
"setup, then hot loop" program. Recorded in ROADMAP.md as the next
JIT item: tracked-num operand support in the arith/compare templates
(read `data.num` through the pointer; the write side must respect
observer semantics).

### Performance — JIT Stage 5: inline fast paths (5a/5b/5c)

The Stage 4 coverage chain left hot loops compiling to single thunks
whose every GET_NAME / SET_NAME / INDEX_SET was an out-of-line helper
call costing roughly what computed-goto dispatch did. Stage 5 emits
the few-instruction fast paths inline and calls the helper only on
guard failure:

- **5a — buffer INDEX_SET**: inline guards (immediate-num index/value,
  heap target, `VAL_BUFFER` type, integral index, bounds) + the
  bounds-checked store, stack commit, and target decref. Any guard
  failure jumps to the existing helper call, which owns all other
  target types and the error paths.
- **5b — GET_NAME / SET name family EnvIC**: the IC entry address is
  baked per call site (the constant pool is final by JIT time); the
  inline path does the starting-env identity + binding-version guards,
  walk-depth 0/1 target resolution, and the slot load+incref (GET) or
  `env_store_slot`-equivalent swap with assign-counts bump (SET).
  Traced assigns (`g_trace_hist`), arena-pointer stores, and IC misses
  route to the helper, which also repopulates the IC. A new `%r15`
  frame-pointer cache (scanner flag `needs_frame_cache`) feeds the
  inline paths; it is pushed twice to preserve the body's
  %rsp ≡ 8 (mod 16) call-alignment invariant.
- **5c — `__loop_iterations__` write cache**: the per-iteration
  `env_set_local` in LOOP_STALL_CHECK (name hash + table walk +
  make_num/decref round-trip, every iteration of every `loop while`)
  now goes through a per-thread (env, binding_version, slot) cache and
  overwrites the immediate-num slot in place, with the same
  assign-counts bump. Semantics unchanged — mid-loop reads see the
  same values — so this also speeds the interpreter.

Numbers (5-run medians): bench_dmg_shape 239→218 ms (−9%),
bench_idxset 29.7→24.6 ms (−17%). Targeted probes isolate the inline
wins: a 2M-iteration module-scope `acc is acc + g` loop runs
191→56 ms (3.4×), a 2M-write unobserved buffer loop 215→77 ms (2.8×).
EIGS_JIT_STOPS stays at zero bailouts on both benchmarks.

Also fixes tests/test_leak_guard.sh, whose standalone ASan build was
missing trace.c and silently skipping since the trace tape landed.

### Performance — JIT coverage: SET name family (Stage 4x)

`SET_NAME`, `SET_NAME_LOCAL`, and `SET_FN_NAME_LOCAL` now compile into
thunks via out-of-line helpers on the GET_NAME ABI (chunk pointer +
name index; interpreter semantics verbatim — trace hook, EnvIC fast
path, resolve/create slow path; no stack effect, no error paths). With
Stage 4v/4w this closes the coverage chain: the fn-local index-write
benchmark compiles to a single thunk with zero bailouts, and
bench_dmg_shape's only remaining bailout is a one-time `DICT` literal.

Honest numbers: flat. Helper-call ABI costs roughly what computed-goto
dispatch did, so coverage alone doesn't move timings — it removes the
structural blocker. The next stage (recorded in ROADMAP.md) is
inlining the EnvIC fast paths into native templates with helper
fallback on IC miss; whole-loop thunks are the prerequisite this
stage delivers.

### Performance — JIT coverage: INDEX_SET + LOOP_STALL_CHECK (Stage 4v/4w)

Driven by the EIGS_JIT_STOPS bailout histogram on the new DMG-shaped
benchmark: INDEX_SET was the only bailout opcode, and LOOP_STALL_CHECK
surfaced next (every observed `while` loop carries one per iteration).
Both now compile into thunks via out-of-line helpers — INDEX_SET on
the INDEX_GET ABI (full opcode semantics in the helper, no bail path),
LOOP_STALL_CHECK on the ITER_NEXT shape (helper returns the exit flag,
emitter conditional-jumps to the exit target). No measurable benchmark
delta on its own: thunks now stop at the name-op family (SET_NAME /
SET_NAME_LOCAL and their inline caches), which is the next stage and
where the accumulated coverage should pay off. jit_smoke gains stubs.

### Performance — temporal history is now compile-gated

Profiling a DMG-shaped dispatch workload (new
`tests/bench_dmg_shape.eigs`, 500k dispatch-table steps) showed the
0.11.7 reversibility machinery running unconditionally: 17.8M
`trace_line` and 2.5M `trace_assign` calls — roughly a third of
runtime — whether or not the program ever asked a temporal question.

- **`g_trace_hist`**: per-assign history recording (prev-table, line
  stamps, tape `A` records) now gates on a compiler-set flag, enabled
  by `prev of`, any `at <expr>` qualifier, a `state_at` reference, or
  an open `EIGS_TRACE` tape. `OP_LINE` stores the current line as a
  plain global write instead of a call. Programs with no temporal
  queries also stop accumulating history memory entirely.
- Measured: dmg-shape 295 → 243 ms (−18%); for-loop 50k −32%;
  while 100k −23%; listcomp 20k −57%; observe 10k −44%.
- Post-fix profile for the 0.12.0 push: ~65% vm_run dispatch, then
  env churn (2.58M `env_free`/run ≈ one per call) and `make_num`
  (2.1M). Recorded in ROADMAP.md.

### Fixed
- **Exit-time segfault when a top-level `unobserved` block promoted
  module slots.** Module chunks carry promoted `local_count` slots
  without a `local_names` array (only fn/lambda chunks build one);
  `chunk_free`'s name loop dereferenced NULL. Latent since the loop
  was written — exposed the moment script chunks became freeable
  (0.11.8 chunk refcounting), and invisible to the suite because the
  crash lands *after* correct output and most checks ignore exit
  codes. New suite check [71] runs a promoting script and asserts
  rc=0.

### Added — temporal interrogatives complete the matrix

- **`where`/`why`/`how ... at <line>`** — the observer-derived
  interrogatives now answer historically. Each assignment's history
  entry stamps an observer snapshot (entropy, dH, last_entropy) taken
  with the same ensure-fresh semantics a live query uses, so
  `why is x at 42` returns exactly what `why is x` would have at that
  moment. Capture is compile-gated (`g_trace_obs_hist`): the compiler
  flips it when it sees such a query, so programs that never ask pay
  nothing and the lazy-entropy optimization is undisturbed. Snapshots
  live in a parallel array keyed off the history index (`obs_start`
  handles capture enabling mid-run via eval/REPL). Regression:
  test_temporal.eigs [70] grows to 23 checks, comparing historical
  answers against live values captured at the time.
- **`EIGS_REPLAY_STRICT=1`** — replay name mismatches become fatal
  (diagnostic + exit 3) instead of warn-and-use-anyway, for harnesses
  where tape/program drift should fail loudly. Default stays lenient.
  Regression: test_replay.sh grows to 6 checks (lenient + strict).

## [0.11.8] — 2026-06-10

A reversibility-hardening + memory-correctness release: `state_at`
gets its Phase 4 snapshot cache, container values replay from tape,
the entire suite runs leak-clean under AddressSanitizer (now enforced
in CI), and bytecode chunks are reference-counted — closing the last
deliberate leak and a REPL use-after-free.

### Added — chunk refcounting

Bytecode chunks now carry a refcount: one creator ref (the
`compile_ast` caller, or the parent chunk's `functions[]` slot for
nested chunks), one per live `VAL_FN` (taken in `OP_CLOSURE`, dropped
in `free_val`), and one per active call frame (so a function whose
last value ref dies mid-call cannot have its code freed under it; the
fn value was already popped and decref'd before frame push). JIT
return thunks write `chunk->jit_advance` *after* `jit_helper_return`
runs, so the popped frame's chunk ref is released in vm_run's post-
thunk sentinel handler rather than the helper. The JIT hotness
registry drops its bare pointer via `jit_unregister_chunk` when a
chunk dies.

Consequences: the script path, REPL, `eval`, `load_file`, and
`import` now free their chunks unconditionally (`import` previously
leaked its module chunk entirely); the REPL/`eval` fn-defining-chunk
retention workaround is gone; atomics gate on `g_vm_multithreaded`
like every other refcount.

### Fixed — memory: the suite now runs leak-clean under ASan

Chased the "intentional don't-free-at-exit baseline" and found it was
hiding real per-call leaks and one use-after-free. Every script the
suite runs — all 1279 checks, all 28 example smokes — now exits with
zero ASan leak reports, and CI's sanitizer job runs with
`detect_leaks=1` so any new leak fails the build.

- **Use-after-free: REPL functions died with their chunk.** The REPL
  freed each line's compiled chunk after execution, but fn values hold
  bare pointers into the chunk's nested function chunks — defining a
  function on one REPL line and calling it on a later line read freed
  memory (release builds survived by luck). Chunks that define
  functions are now intentionally retained (same policy as the script
  path's existing chunk TODO); function-less chunks are freed.
- **Stranded birth refs at every adopting store.** `env_set_local`,
  `list_append`, and `dict_set` all incref internally, so the
  ubiquitous `store(make_value(...))` idiom left every stored fresh
  value at refcount 2 with one owner — unfreeable by any teardown. New
  adopting helpers `env_set_local_owned` / `list_append_owned` /
  `dict_set_owned` consume the birth ref; 245 builtin registrations,
  67 list appends, and 49 dict stores converted. Recurring-leak
  call sites fixed along the way: `json_decode` (whole parse tree,
  per call), `json_path` (root tree, per call), `observe` (report
  string), `sort_by` (key results), `args`, `random_normal` (rows),
  `tensor` element-wise/unary/zeros builders, the `numerical_grad`
  family (probe values double-ref'd, loss results never released,
  zero placeholders overwritten without release), closure param
  temporaries (one strdup'd array per closure creation), per-env
  `assign_counts` (every env teardown), and the REPL's per-line AST
  and result values. `try_parse`/`eval` now free their ASTs.
- **Global env teardown at exit.** `env_free` is refcount-honest and
  no-ops while closures hold the env — at exit that leaked the whole
  global scope (191 builtins minimum) because top-level fns live in
  the env they capture. New `env_destroy_final` breaks the cycle
  reentrancy-safely; main tears down trace → env → arena in that
  order on both the script and REPL paths.
- **Replay no longer performs the live work it discards.** Builtins
  that did real I/O before their tape hook (`read_bytes`,
  `read_bytes_buf`, `read_text`, `random_normal`, `http_post`) ran
  that work under `EIGS_REPLAY` and leaked the abandoned live value —
  `http_post` even issued the real network request. New
  `TRACE_NONDET_TAKE`/`TRACE_NONDET_RECORD` pair consumes the call's
  N record up front (exactly one record per call, ordering contract
  intact) and skips the live path entirely.

### Added
- **Line-floor index for backward temporal queries** (the deferred
  Phase 4 snapshot cache). Each name's assignment history now carries
  a periodic index: the minimum line stamp per 64-entry segment.
  `state_at(line)` and the `at <line>` interrogative qualifier skip
  whole segments whose floor exceeds the query line — the loop-heavy
  worst case (deep histories stamped with the same few lines, i.e. a
  debugger scrubbing the timeline) drops from O(H) to O(H/64 + 64)
  per name. Measured: 200 `state_at` queries against 200 000-entry
  histories went from 58 ms to 1.1 ms (~50×). Overhead is one `int`
  per 64 history entries and an O(1) min-update per assign; if the
  index allocation ever fails the name falls back to the plain linear
  scan. Regression: `tests/test_temporal.eigs` ([70], 18 checks) —
  first suite coverage for `prev of` / `at` / `state_at`, including
  a 300-assign loop history that crosses several index segments.
- **Replay of container values.** `parse_value` in `src/trace.c` rewritten
  as a recursive-descent cursor parser; nondet returns that are lists,
  dicts, or buffers now round-trip through `EIGS_REPLAY` instead of
  falling through to the live source (closes the "containers return null"
  caveat from 0.11.7). Buffer serialization gains a leading `b` so
  `b[1,2,3]` disambiguates from a list `[1,2,3]`. Regression:
  `tests/test_replay.sh` — list (`read_bytes`), buffer (`read_bytes_buf`),
  dict (handcrafted `N` record), and nested list-of-dicts-and-buffer;
  each case mutates the underlying file between record and replay to
  prove the value comes from the tape.

### Documentation
- Documented the 0.11.7 reversibility surface: temporal interrogatives
  (`prev of`, `at`) in SYNTAX.md and GRAMMAR.md, `state_at` in
  BUILTINS.md, and a new docs/TRACE.md covering the `EIGS_TRACE` /
  `EIGS_REPLAY` tape format and replay semantics.
- Folded an orphaned `[Unreleased]` section (between 0.10.0 and 0.9.3.4)
  into the 0.10.0 entry it shipped with.

## [0.11.7] — 2026-06-09

A trace + time-travel release. The interpreter learns to remember its
own past — both at the language level (interrogatives that query prior
state) and at the runtime level (a recordable, replayable tape of every
nondeterministic input). The graphical debugger gains step-back.

### Added — Temporal interrogatives

- **`prev of x`** — value of `x` immediately before its most recent
  assign. Parsed with the `of` connector (vs. `is` for what/who/when),
  encoded as interrogative kind 6. Backed by a process-wide prev-table
  keyed by interned-name pointer (open-addressing, fibonacci-hashed),
  populated on every `OP_GSET`. Cost per assign: one cache line + a
  pointer compare. Works whether or not `EIGS_TRACE` is set — this is
  language surface, not debug-only.
- **`at <expr>` qualifier** — any interrogative can be temporally
  qualified: `what is x at 42`, `prev of x at L`, `when is x at L`,
  `who is x at L`. Walks per-name history (line-stamped, append-only)
  backward to the last assign with line ≤ L. The line operand is a
  full expression; `at` is a soft keyword that falls back to `IDENT`
  outside interrogative position. Lib/example collisions (`prev` as
  a variable in `lib/eigen.eigs`, `examples/invariant_decomposition.eigs`)
  renamed to `prior` to make the keyword unambiguous.

### Added — Execution trace tape

`EIGS_TRACE=<path>` opens a text tape and records three event kinds:

- `L <line>` — source-line events from `OP_LINE` (adjacent duplicates
  with no A/N in between are deduped — the compiler emits per-statement
  LINEs and bare repeats are noise).
- `A <name>=<value>` — name-keyed assignment deltas.
- `N <fn>=<value>` — nondeterministic builtin returns (random,
  monotonic_*, env_get, read_*, random_hex, http_post, …).

Full-fidelity nondet writer: per-record byte budget of 64 KiB, recursive
emission of lists/dicts/buffers, strings escape `\"`, `\\`, `\n`, `\r`,
`\xNN`, truncation marker on overflow so partial records remain visually
parseable. Disabled cost is one predicted-not-taken load + branch at each
hook site.

### Added — HTTP nondet capture

The HTTP extension's request/response surface is nondeterministic from
the script's perspective. Wrapped returns in `ext_http.c` for:

- `http_post` (success + 7 error paths)
- `http_request_body`, `http_session_id`, `http_request_headers`
  (TLS-state-or-default returns)

Every call lands on the tape as an `N` record, making HTTP-driven
EigenScript runs reproducible.

### Added — Deterministic replay

`EIGS_REPLAY=<path>` opens a previously-recorded tape and serves the
`N` records to nondet builtins in order. Subsequent runs produce
byte-identical output: same random sequence, same monotonic_ns
timestamps, same HTTP responses. Implementation:

- Streaming reader skips `L` and `A` records, parses the next `N`
  value (num/null/bool/string today; lists/dicts return null so the
  builtin falls back to the live source — future work).
- Tape exhaustion gracefully switches off replay; remaining calls hit
  the real source.
- Name mismatches log a warning and use the recorded value anyway
  (lenient Phase 3.0 policy — strict ordering is the contract, names
  are for human-readable debug).
- `TRACE_NONDET_RET` centralized in `trace.h` so the replay short-circuit
  applies uniformly to every nondet builtin; three duplicate copies in
  `builtins.c`, `builtins_tensor.c`, `ext_http.c` removed.

### Added — `state_at(line)` builtin

Returns a dict of every tracked binding's value at or before `line`.
Walks the prev-table's per-name history with backward linear scan —
the existing history records `(line, value)` on every assign, so no
separate snapshot data structures were needed. Periodic snapshot
caching deferred until the linear scan is a profiled bottleneck.

### Added — Debugger step-back UI

`examples/debugger.eigs` gains F8/F11 history navigation while paused:

- The debug hook captures `(line, env-snapshot)` on every statement.
  Snapshots flatten the meta-circular env chain into a `{name: value}`
  dict (inner shadows outer; fn-shaped values skipped). FIFO-capped
  at 10 000 steps.
- F8 walks the view cursor backward; F11 forward; the cursor snaps
  back to live (-1) at the end or when execution resumes (F5/F9/F10).
- Inspector reads from the snapshot; source view highlights the
  historical line in cool blue (vs. live yellow); status bar switches
  to `History step K/N — line L`. Toolbar gains `Back F8` / `Fwd F11`.
- Trace machinery is not wired in here: it tracks host-VM globals,
  and the meta-circular interpreter has its own env dict. Snapshotting
  in the hook is the layer that actually owns the data.

### Suite

1257/1257 base, 15/15 HTTP, all three build variants (default, http+model,
gfx) green.

## [0.11.6] — 2026-06-09

### Fixed (HTTP server availability + protocol hygiene)

Surfaced by attacking the EigenScript HTTP runtime locally against the
landing site at `eigen-site/`. Code review and the existing test harness
both missed these — the underlying defects were architectural (single
accept loop) or in branches the test suite never exercised (HEAD, bad
versions, oversized headers).

- **Single-threaded accept → trivial slowloris DoS.** `http_serve_blocking`
  ran `handle_request` synchronously on the accept thread, so one client
  that opened a TCP connection and sent a partial header line wedged
  every subsequent request until the per-connection deadline expired.
  200 such connections from one host took the site offline. Accepts now
  hand each connection to a detached pthread; the request-state globals
  (`request_body`, `request_headers`, `session_id`, plus a new HEAD
  body-suppression flag) moved to `__thread` storage so workers don't
  trample each other. Concurrency is capped at 256 active connections;
  past that the listener sheds load with `503 Service Unavailable`
  instead of queueing. Regression: `tests/test_http_server.sh` HS13
  (16 slow conns served + GET still completes in <1.5 s).
- **HEAD requests returned 404.** Only GET routes were registered, so
  `HEAD /` fell through to the not-found path even when `GET /` existed.
  HEAD now reroutes to the GET handler and `send_response` skips the
  body via a TLS suppression flag, so callers get correct headers and
  Content-Length with an empty body. Regression: HS10.
- **HTTP version was unvalidated.** `sscanf` read the third token of the
  request line without checking it, so `GET / HTTP/junk` was served as
  200 OK. Now strictly requires `HTTP/<digit>`; everything else gets a
  400. Regression: HS11.
- **OPTIONS preflight returned 200 with empty body and no Allow header.**
  Any client probing methods got a content-free 200 instead of a proper
  preflight. Now answers 204 No Content with `Allow: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS`
  and mirrors CORS headers when `http_cors` is configured. Regression:
  HS07/HS07b.
- **Negative / oversized Content-Length hung the connection.** The old
  guard `free(reqbuf); close(fd)` silently dropped the request, so the
  client waited until its own timeout (or, with worse luck, until the
  30 s per-connection deadline). Now answers `400 Bad Request` with a
  reason string so misbehaving clients see a real error. Regression:
  HS08.
- **Oversized headers were silently truncated to 200 OK.** When the
  request-buffer ceiling (`max_body + 64 KiB`) was hit *before* finding
  `\r\n\r\n`, the read loop broke out and `sscanf` happily parsed the
  request line from whatever prefix had arrived — so a 17 MiB X-Big
  header value yielded a 200 instead of 431. Now answers `431 Request
  Header Fields Too Large` whenever the buffer caps with `header_end`
  still unset. Regression: HS12.

### Removed (struct hygiene)
- Removed `request_body`, `request_headers`, `session_id` from the
  `Server` struct in `ext_http_internal.h` (and their two zero-inits in
  `main.c`). These fields are now thread-local per the threading fix,
  so the struct slots were dead.

## [0.11.5] — 2026-06-09

### Fixed (memory safety)
- **Per-call leak from compensating incref on builtin returns.** The
  `CASE(CALL) VAL_BUILTIN`, `jit_helper_call`, and `OP_DISPATCH` paths
  unconditionally `val_incref`'d the result of every builtin call to keep
  borrowed pointers (e.g. `coalesce`/`append` returning `arg->items[k]`)
  alive across the subsequent `val_decref(arg)`. The same `+1` also fired
  for builtins that return a *fresh* allocation (`range`, `make_str`,
  `keys`, …), so every such call leaked one `Value` plus its contents.
  `for i in range of 1M` silently retained ~80 MB. Replaced with a
  direct-borrow scan that only incref's when `result` is one of `arg`'s
  top-level items; nested borrows like `get_at` keep their local incref.
  `OP_DISPATCH` additionally had `val_decref(arg)` *before* the incref,
  which was a UAF for direct borrows — reordered to match `CASE(CALL)`.
  Regression: `tests/test_leak_guard.sh` (ASan).
- **Use-after-free on consuming builtins via the direct-borrow scan.**
  The leak fix's borrow scan reads `arg->type` *after* the builtin call,
  but `free_val` is a consuming builtin that decrefs `arg` internally —
  on a refcount-1 argument that left the scan reading freed memory. The
  full-suite ASan/UBSan CI job (which a targeted leak guard couldn't have
  caught — the corruption is invisible without a sanitizer watching)
  surfaced it. Gated the scan and the trailing `val_decref(arg)` on
  `!consumes_arg` at all three call sites (`CASE(CALL)`, `jit_helper_call`,
  `OP_DISPATCH`).

### Added (infrastructure)
- **Cross-platform / cross-compiler CI matrix.** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  now runs `build-and-test` across ubuntu-latest+gcc, ubuntu-latest+clang,
  and macos-latest+clang (fail-fast off so one platform's failure doesn't
  hide the others), plus a dedicated `sanitizers` job that builds the
  whole runtime with `-fsanitize=address,undefined` and runs the full
  suite under it. `build.sh` honors `$CC` so the matrix can pick the
  compiler. New `make asan` target for local memory-bug hunting.
- **`tests/test_leak_guard.sh`** — ASan regression guard for the builtin
  ref-protocol leak. Builds a minimal ASan eigenscript, runs `range` /
  `make_str` / `keys` / `append` loops, fails if `make_list`/`make_str`/
  `make_dict` appear in any leak frame or if `append`'s borrowed return
  surfaces a UAF. Skips cleanly when ASan is unavailable. Wired into
  `run_all_tests.sh` (step `[69]`).

### Fixed (portability)
- **Non-x86 builds (notably macOS arm64).** `eigs_jit_get_layout` used
  inline `__asm__("mov %%fs:0, %0" ...)` to read the x86-64 thread
  pointer for TLS-relative JIT encoding. JIT codegen is already gated
  `#if defined(__x86_64__)` in `jit.c`, so the layout probe only matters
  there; on other arches the function body now collapses to a no-op
  rather than failing to assemble.
- **macOS test portability.** `test_file_io.eigs` RT1 stops reading
  `/etc/hostname` (Linux-only path) — it now stages a tmp file with
  `write_text` first, then reads it back. `test_coverage_gaps.eigs` CG12
  accepts `/private/tmp` as well as `/tmp` for the `chdir`+`getcwd`
  check, since macOS routes `/tmp` through a symlink.

### Documentation
- **README / ROADMAP refresh.** Updated stale binary size (`~328K` →
  `~420K`) and test count (`831/832` → `1257`) in README. Bumped
  ROADMAP's "Current version" from `0.11.0` to `0.11.4`; moved
  in-place numeric mutation, dict field inline caching, dispatch
  builtin re-entry elimination, and the DMG 0.5+ MHz target out of
  "Next" into "Completed"; reframed 0.12 around the copy-and-patch
  JIT + NaN-boxing prerequisites.

### Removed (code hygiene)
- **Dead statics in `src/compiler.c`.** `block_has_closure`, `emit_u16`,
  `begin_scope`, `end_scope`, and `root_compiler` were defined but
  never called, generating `-Wunused-function` warnings on every
  build. Removed.

### Security
- **Bounded parser recursion depth (stack-exhaustion guard).** The
  recursive-descent parser had no bound on expression nesting, so deeply
  nested source — e.g. `eval` of untrusted input like `((((…))))` — could
  exhaust the C stack and crash. Added a 256-level cap (shared by nested
  expressions and blocks); over-deep source now produces a parse error
  instead of a crash. (Block nesting was already capped at 64 by the
  lexer's indent limit; this closes the expression side.)
- **Constant-time secret comparison (`secure_equals` builtin).** Added
  `secure_equals of [a, b]`, which compares two strings without
  short-circuiting on the first differing byte, and switched `lib/auth.eigs`
  to use it for password and bearer-token checks so comparison timing can't
  leak how many leading bytes matched. Regression:
  `tests/test_security_hardening.eigs`.
- **Bounded JSON nesting depth (stack-exhaustion DoS fix).** The recursive
  JSON parser (`eigs_json_parse_value` → array/object) had no depth limit,
  so deeply nested input like `[[[[…]]]]` exhausted the C stack and crashed
  the process with SIGSEGV. Reachable by any program that `json_decode`s
  untrusted input — notably an HTTP server decoding a request body — making
  it a remote denial of service. Added a 200-level nesting cap; input past
  it is refused and parsing terminates cleanly instead of crashing. Normal
  documents are unaffected. Regression: `tests/test_json_depth.eigs`.

### Added
- **`docs/LANGUAGE_CONTRACT.md`** — the language's semantic promises stated
  explicitly (equality, ordering, coercion, errors, numbers, truthiness,
  scope, evaluation, mutability/aliasing, argument unpacking, the full
  operator-precedence table, and indexing), each with an Enforced/Planned
  status and a link to the test that locks it. A living spec to extend
  before adding features.
- **`tests/test_call_semantics.eigs`** — locks two previously-undocumented
  promises: argument unpacking (≥2 params spread a list; a lone param binds
  the whole argument) and reference aliasing (assignment shares containers,
  does not copy).
- **`tests/test_stem_accuracy.eigs`** — a 123-check known-answer audit of
  the STEM libraries (physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, geometry,
  linalg, calculus, probability, stats, numerics, optimize) against
  textbook values. Every check passes: e.g. `gravitational_force` matches
  the 2019 CODATA G, `normal_pdf(0,0,1)` matches 1/√(2π) to 16 digits,
  `rk4` lands on e, Simpson/trapezoidal/midpoint integration and Newton/
  secant/bisection root-finding all hit their analytic answers.
- **`variance_sample` / `std_dev_sample`** in `lib/stats.eigs` — sample
  variance/standard deviation with Bessel's correction (÷N−1). The
  existing `variance`/`std_dev` remain **population** statistics (÷N); the
  difference is now documented in the source and both forms are tested.

### Changed (behavior change)
- **`==` / `!=` are now structural for collections.** Lists and dicts
  previously compared by reference identity, so `[1,2] == [1,2]` was
  `false`. They now compare by structure (lists element-wise, dicts by
  key/value order-independently, buffers/text-builders by contents);
  numbers/strings/null by value; functions and builtins still by identity;
  mixed types are never equal (no coercion). This also makes `match` work
  on list/dict patterns. See `tests/test_equality.eigs`.
- **Numbers print round-trippably.** `value_to_string` used `%.6g`, which
  truncated every non-integer to 6 significant figures (and any integer
  >= 1e15 to lossy scientific form) — `1/3` printed `0.333333`,
  `0.1 + 0.2` printed `0.3`. It now emits the shortest representation that
  parses back to the same double (15–17 significant digits as needed), so
  `0.1 + 0.2` prints `0.30000000000000004` and `str`/`num` round-trip.
  Exact integers up to 2^53 still print without a decimal point. See
  `tests/test_number_format.eigs`.

### Changed (behavior change), continued
- **Mixed-type ordering now raises instead of silently returning false.**
  `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` previously returned `false` when the operands were
  different types (`"3" < 4` was `false`), masking type confusion. They
  now require both operands to be the same comparable type (number/number
  or string/string) and raise a runtime error otherwise (catchable with
  `try`/`catch`). Equality (`==`/`!=`) is unchanged: it never coerces and
  cross-type compares are simply not-equal, never an error.
- **`+` no longer coerces across types.** It adds two numbers or
  concatenates two strings; a mixed operand (`"n=" + 42`, `7 + "x"`) now
  raises instead of silently stringifying (`"3" + 4` used to be `"34"`).
  Use an f-string — `f"n={count}"` — or `str of` to mix types in text.
  (The old coercion path also truncated numbers via `%.14g`; that's moot
  now.) `of` precedence (`len of xs - 1` parses as `(len of xs) - 1`) is
  documented in docs/SYNTAX.md, not changed — the two natural readings
  conflict, and the current rule matches the common idiom.
- **Builtin argument errors now raise instead of warning and returning
  `null`.** `EigenStore` builtins (`store_open`/`put`/`get`/`delete`/
  `query`/`count`/`update`/`collections`/`drop`/`close`), `json_decode`,
  and `load_file` previously printed an `Error:`/`Type error:` line to
  stderr and returned `null` on bad input, so a misuse silently produced
  `null` and the program continued. They now route through the same
  `runtime_error` channel as the rest of the VM — caught by an enclosing
  `try`, otherwise fatal. Non-error outcomes are unchanged: a `store_get`
  miss still returns `null`, a `store_delete` of a missing key still
  returns `0`. (`runtime_error` is now declared in `eigenscript.h` and
  strips a trailing newline so caught messages are clean.) Remaining
  lenient spots, left for a follow-up: a file-open failure in the stream
  builtins, and the optional model extension.

### Fixed (behavior change)
- **Uncaught runtime errors are now fatal and set a non-zero exit code.**
  Previously an uncaught error (undefined variable, index out of range,
  calling a non-function, operator type mismatch, call-stack overflow)
  printed a message, substituted `null`, and execution *continued* — and
  the process still exited `0`. Scripts could fail silently and report
  success, and a stack overflow produced a cascade of follow-on errors
  rather than one. `vm_run` now unwinds to the nearest enclosing `try`
  (across re-entrant calls), or halts the program if there is none, and
  `main` returns `1` when an uncaught error occurred. `try`/`catch`
  behavior is unchanged; caught errors still let the program continue and
  exit `0`. Migration: wrap recoverable operations in `try`/`catch`.
  Note: builtins on the separate "soft" channel (e.g. `store_*` and
  `json_decode`, which print `Error:`/`Type error:` without raising) still
  return `null` and continue — unifying those into the strict model is a
  follow-up.

## [0.11.4] — 2026-05-23

### Performance
- **Intern dict-stored keys + pointer-equality short-circuit in dict
  inline cache**: dict keys were previously `xstrdup`'d at insert, while
  cache callers pass `chunk->const_interns[idx]` (interned strings) —
  pointer equality never matched, so every dict cache hit paid for a
  `strcmp`. Callgrind on the 0.11.3 PGO binary showed `__strcmp_sse2` at
  **4.06%** of retired instructions, dominated by `dict_get_cached` /
  `dict_set_cached` / `dict_set_cached_immediate`. Switched dict-key
  storage to `env_intern_name` (single insert site at
  `eigenscript.c:621`) and added `stored == key || strcmp(...)` to all
  three cache helpers. Hot DMG field accesses now short-circuit on
  pointer equality. DMG `cpu_instrs` (n=10, PGO, `--cycles 200000`)
  went from **1.042 MHz** to **1.094 MHz** mean (+5.0%).

### Build
- Added `make pgo` target: builds an instrumented binary, runs DMG
  cpu_instrs as the default training workload, then rebuilds with
  `-fprofile-use`. ~+8–9% net on the trained workload. `PGO_RUN` and
  `PGO_DIR` overridable for different training workloads.
- Fixed `build.sh` drift: missing `jit.c` in `SOURCES` (broke since the
  VM-layer split) and missing `EIGENSCRIPT_EXT_*` macros in the
  full-build branch.

## [0.11.3] — 2026-05-23

### Performance
- **Gate refcount atomics on `g_vm_multithreaded` flag**: on x86 every
  `__atomic_*_fetch` for refcount work emits a LOCK-prefixed RMW (~20
  cycles each), regardless of memory order. Added a runtime flag,
  default 0, flipped to 1 by `builtin_spawn` before `pthread_create`.
  All `val_incref/decref`, `slot_incref/decref`, and `env_refcount`
  inc/dec/load sites branch on the flag with `__builtin_expect(0)`
  and use plain `++/--` in the single-threaded case. DMG `cpu_instrs`
  (n=10, `--cycles 200000`) went from **0.767 MHz** (0.11.2 baseline)
  to **0.950 MHz** mean (+24%), clearing the Phase B Gate (0.85 MHz)
  with 12% margin.

### Diagnostics
- Per-chunk `jit_stop_op` field + extended `EIGS_JIT_HOT=1` table
  (adv/len/nat%/stop columns + aggregate native-byte share). Surfaces
  the static native-bytecode coverage of JIT-compiled chunks; revealed
  that helper-call prefix extension was hitting diminishing returns
  (~6% native-byte share across all hot chunks).

## [0.11.2] — 2026-05-22

### Bug Fixes
- **`break` in `while` loop corrupted stack**: AST_LOOP patched break
  jumps to land *after* its trailing OP_NULL, so the break path skipped
  the loop's result push while the compile-time tracker (and AST_BREAK's
  +1 phantom) assumed it was there. A statement following the loop then
  popped a stale heap pointer and segfaulted. Patch break jumps before
  OP_NULL so all exit paths agree.
- **`break` in `while` loop freed the global env**: AST_BREAK
  unconditionally emitted OP_LOOP_ENV_END, but only AST_FOR allocates a
  per-iteration env. Breaking out of a `while` therefore released the
  surrounding (often global) env. Track `has_fresh_env` per loop and emit
  OP_LOOP_ENV_END only when set.
- **`local[const]` indexing silently masked errors**: OP_LOCAL_IDX_GET
  (the fused fast path for `arr[i]` on a local slot) returned null on
  out-of-range or wrong-type targets instead of raising runtime_error.
  This made try/catch around errors-inside-functions appear broken
  (error never propagated; function silently returned null). Bring its
  error semantics in line with unfused INDEX_GET.
- **`local[const].field` silently masked errors**: same class of bug in
  OP_LOCAL_IDX_DOT_GET / OP_LOCAL_IDX_DOT_SET. Out-of-range list index
  silently returned null / no-op; non-list non-null targets silently
  failed. Now error like unfused INDEX_GET/INDEX_SET + DOT_GET/SET.
- **64K buffer index truncation**: `idx < (uint16_t)count` truncated
  count to 16 bits — a 65536-byte buffer (e.g. a Game Boy 64K address
  space) reported every index as out-of-range. Compare as int.

### Cleanups
- Drop redundant `slot < (uint16_t)e->count` casts across 7 slot-bounds
  checks in GET_LOCAL / SET_LOCAL / LOCAL_DOT_GET/SET / LOCAL_IDX_GET /
  LOCAL_IDX_DOT_GET/SET. Compare `(int)slot < e->count` directly.

### Test Suite
- Full suite now reaches **1030/1030 PASS, 0 FAIL** (previously halted
  at `[29/31] Break & Continue` on the segfault above, reporting 141
  PASS).

## [0.11.1] — 2026-05-21

### Performance (DMG benchmark: 0.318 → 0.384 MHz, +21%)
- **In-place numeric mutation**: arithmetic ops reuse refcount-1 Values
  instead of allocating via make_num.
- **Dict field inline cache**: 128-entry direct-mapped cache for
  DOT_GET/DOT_SET (99.99% hit rate on DMG workload).
- **Superinstructions**: LOCAL_DOT_GET/SET, LOCAL_IDX_GET,
  LOCAL_IDX_DOT_GET/SET fuse 2-4 dispatches into one.
- **Stack-top arithmetic**: ARITH_FAST macro operates directly on
  stack[] without push/pop for num+num fast path.
- **JUMP_IF_FALSE/TRUE**: inlined numeric check bypasses is_truthy().
- **POP**: inlined val_decref avoids function call.

### Bug Fixes (Audit)
- **Break in for-loops**: emit LOOP_ENV_END before break jump to
  prevent env leak and stack corruption.
- **Observer `who is x`**: returns binding name ("x") instead of type
  name ("number"). New OP_INTERROGATE_NAMED opcode.
- **Observer `when is x`**: returns assignment count via per-slot
  assign_counts[] in Env. Tracks increments across env_set.
- **Compound assignment `a[f()] += x`**: index expression now evaluated
  exactly once via new OP_DUP2 opcode + compiler bytecode lowering.
- **Bitwise precedence**: comparison RHS now parses bitwise operators
  (`1 == 1 | 0` works).
- **Dict non-string keys**: runtime error instead of silent collapse
  to "?" key.
- **Postfix after grouping**: `(expr).field` and `(expr)[idx]` both
  parse correctly.
- **Dedent validation**: mismatched indentation levels now produce
  syntax errors.
- **Superinstruction error semantics**: LOCAL_DOT_GET/SET emit proper
  runtime_error for non-dict targets (was silently returning null).

### New Opcodes
- `OP_DUP2` — duplicate top two stack values
- `OP_INTERROGATE_NAMED` — who/when with binding name operand
- `OP_LOCAL_DOT_GET`, `OP_LOCAL_DOT_SET` — fused local.field access
- `OP_LOCAL_IDX_GET` — fused local[const] access
- `OP_LOCAL_IDX_DOT_GET`, `OP_LOCAL_IDX_DOT_SET` — fused local[n].field

## [0.11.0] — 2026-05-21

### Bytecode VM Completeness
- **Zero VM bugs remaining.** Fixed all 14 bytecode VM test failures
  from the 0.10.0 release. The VM is now fully compatible with the
  tree-walker's behavior across all 92 test files.

### Bug Fixes
- **Try/catch handler stack**: nested try/catch with rethrow now works
  correctly (max 8 nested per frame).
- **Type error reporting**: runtime_error for SUB, MUL, DIV, MOD, NEG
  on wrong types; DOT_GET/DOT_SET on non-dict; INDEX_GET/INDEX_SET
  for OOB and non-indexable; ITER_SETUP for non-iterable.
- **Error message compatibility**: "out of bounds" → "out of range";
  WHO interrogative returns "number"/"string"/"function" (not short names).
- **Division by zero**: warning to stderr instead of runtime_error
  (matches tree-walker behavior).
- **String concatenation**: string + non-string uses value_to_string
  instead of returning null.
- **Builtin result refcount**: sort/append returning their input no
  longer causes double-free.
- **Listcomp with filter**: save/restore stack depth at filter branch
  point (was crashing).
- **Break/continue outside loop**: emit NULL instead of phantom stack
  adjust (was corrupting closures containing break).
- **Observer obs_age**: increment in update_observer (was missing after
  eval.c → eigenscript.c migration).
- **1-element list args**: `f of [x]` passes `[x]` as a list, not `x`
  as a scalar (fixes softmax, mat_det, and similar builtins).
- **0-param functions**: call_eigs_fn skips param binding when
  param_count == 0 (was accessing NULL params).

## [0.10.0] — 2026-05-21

### Architecture — Bytecode VM
- **Replaced AST tree-walker with bytecode VM.** All code now compiles to
  bytecode and runs through a stack-based VM with computed-goto dispatch.
  `eval.c` (1387 lines) deleted, replaced by `compiler.c` + `vm.c` + `chunk.c`
  (~2400 lines). Net +1250 lines for the entire VM.
- **60+ opcodes** covering all 31 AST node types: constants, arithmetic,
  comparison, bitwise, variables (local slots + name-based), control flow
  (jumps, loops, iteration), functions (closure, call, return), data
  structures (list, dict, index, dot), error handling (try/catch), observer
  system (interrogate, predicate, stall detection), and modules (import).
- **Non-recursive function calls.** `OP_CALL` pushes a new frame and
  continues the dispatch loop. No C stack recursion — recursion depth
  limited by `VM_FRAMES_MAX` (4096) instead of C stack size.
- **Stack-depth tracking** in the compiler validates branch/loop balance.
- **GET_LOCAL/SET_LOCAL** optimization for function parameters: direct
  env slot access bypasses hash table lookup.
- **Observer stall detection** (`OP_LOOP_STALL_CHECK`): while-loops exit
  after 100 iterations of `|dH| < threshold`. Sets `__loop_exit__` and
  `__loop_iterations__` env variables.

### Language
- **Compound assignment operators**: `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `&=`,
  `|=`, `^=`, `<<=`, `>>=`. Desugared in the parser to existing AST nodes.
  Works on variables, dot-access, and index-access.
- **Buffer iteration**: `for x in buffer:` and `[expr for x in buffer]` now
  work. `what`/`who` interrogation handles buffers. VAL_BUFFER is now a
  first-class iterable type.

### Performance
- **For-loop env reuse**: Reuse a single `Env` per for-loop and list
  comprehension instead of allocating/freeing per iteration. Falls back to
  fresh allocation when closures capture the loop scope.
- **Lazy observer entropy**: Assignments mark values dirty; `compute_entropy`
  deferred until observer state is actually read. In-place NUM fast path
  eagerly computes entropy (O(1) for numbers).
- **Thread-local observer state**: `g_last_observer` replaces the
  `__observer__` env variable, eliminating hash lookup and atomic refcount
  per assignment and function call.
- **String concat fast path**: `make_str_owned` avoids double-copy;
  STR+STR concat skips `value_to_string`.
- **Keyword dispatch**: `keyword_type` uses `switch(word[0])` instead of
  37 sequential `strcmp` calls.
- **Environment hash index**: FNV-1a hash table for O(1) variable lookup in
  `env_get`/`env_set`/`env_set_local`, replacing linear scan.
- **Dict hash index**: Dicts now use the same FNV-1a hash table for O(1) key
  lookup in `dict_get`/`dict_set`/`dict_remove`, replacing O(n) linear scan.
- **Loop condition fast path**: `eval_num_fast` extended with comparison
  operators (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`). Loop conditions like
  `while x < limit:` now evaluate with zero allocation.
- **Relaxed atomic refcounting**: `val_incref` uses `RELAXED` ordering,
  `val_decref` uses `ACQ_REL` (was `SEQ_CST`). Eliminates unnecessary full
  memory barriers on every refcount operation.
- **Allocation origin fix**: `list_append` and `env_set_local` now use the
  owning structure's arena flag (not `g_arena.active`) to decide allocation
  strategy, eliminating the `is_arena_ptr()` linear scan on every
  `free_value`.
- **Memory leak fixes**: Safe `val_decref` on fresh Values from loop
  conditions, list comprehension filters, and match patterns. Closure
  environments are freed when all referencing closures are destroyed (atomic
  `env_refcount`). Thread `call_env` is freed after thread body completes.
  Arena overflow allocations are tracked and freed on `arena_reset`.
  `arena_destroy` frees all arena blocks at program exit.

### Builtins
- `list_truncate of [list, new_len]` — in-place O(1) list shrink.
- `list_remove_at of [list, index]` — in-place element removal with memmove.
- `sort_by of [list, key_fn]` — C-backed O(n log n) qsort with key function
  (replaces O(n²) pure-EigenScript insertion sort in lib/sort.eigs).
- `sign_extend of [val, bits]` — sign-extend a value from a given bit width
- `scan_ints of text` / `scan_ints of [text, comment_marker]` — C-backed scan
  of whitespace-delimited signed integer tokens, optionally skipping comment
  lines
- `scan_int_tokens of text` / `scan_int_tokens of [text, comment_marker]` —
  C-backed token spans with signed-integer classification and value metadata
- `text_builder_new`, `text_builder_append`, `text_builder_append_line`,
  `text_builder_extend`, `text_builder_part_count`, `text_builder_clear`,
  and `text_builder_to_string` — native growable text builder builtins used by
  `lib/text_builder.eigs`
- `sort of list` — in-place qsort on numeric lists
- `read_bytes_buf of path` — read binary file as VAL_BUFFER (zero per-element alloc)
- `gfx_fb of [buf, w, h, x, y, scale]` — blit a buffer as a scaled texture
- `ppu_render_frame of [mem_buf, fb_buf]` — full Game Boy PPU rendering in C

### Standard Library
- `lib/int_vector.eigs` wraps root buffers as fixed-size integer vectors for
  solver-style dense integer state, with direct indexing and copy helpers.

### Hardening
- Finite-number invariant: numeric construction, scalar arithmetic, tensor
  arithmetic, math builtins, and numeric fast paths now prevent `NaN`/`Inf`
  from entering EigenScript values. `NaN` collapses to `0`; overflow and
  infinity saturate at `+/-1e308`; domain-limited inverse trig clamps inputs.
- Shift-amount bounds checks (`<<`, `>>`) — out-of-range yields 0, not UB
- Null guards on dot-assign, index-assign, and list comprehension targets
- JSON control-character escaping for bytes < 0x20
- F-string recursion depth limit (max 64 levels)
- Parser bounds checks for lambda lookahead
- HTTP Content-Length search scoped to headers only
- Store handle release before free (use-after-free fix)

## [0.9.3.4] — 2026-04-25

### UI Toolkit

- **Widget registry**: replace 74 hardcoded type dispatches with registry
  pattern. Adding a new widget type now requires one registration block
  instead of editing 6+ functions.
- **Layout position caching**: cache absolute positions (`_ax`/`_ay`) during
  layout pass, eliminating 53 per-frame tree walks in event dispatch.
- **Frame-rate independent timers**: cursor blink and tooltip delay now use
  millisecond timestamps instead of frame counters.
- **Keyboard accessibility**: 10 widget types (grid, chart, bar_chart,
  color_picker, canvas, waveform_view, piano_kb, editable_label, code_view,
  gauge) are now keyboard-accessible via Tab + arrow/Enter/Space.
- **File decomposition**: split 4522-line `ui.eigs` into 14 focused files
  grouped by widget category.
- **UI unit tests**: 81 new assertions covering constructors, registry,
  layout, hit-testing, focus cycling, scroll clamping, and keyboard nav.

### Bug Fixes

- **SDL2 dlsym crash**: validate all `dlsym` results — missing symbols now
  fail with a diagnostic instead of segfaulting via NULL function pointer.
- **SDL2 audio null-check**: `audio_open` now checks for audio symbol
  availability before calling.
- **`gfx_open` window leak**: destroy window on renderer creation failure.
- **`gfx_close` resource leak**: close audio device and `dlclose` SDL2
  library handle on shutdown.
- **Focus ring overwrite**: focus ring no longer fills over widget content
  with `panel_bg`; draws four edge rects instead.
- **Scroll wheel targeting**: wheel events now scroll only the scrollable
  widget under the cursor, not all scrollable containers.
- **`gfx_delay` CPU burn**: increased from 1ms to 8ms for software-renderer
  fallback when vsync is unavailable.

## [0.9.3.3] — 2026-04-25

### Security
- **`screen_render` overflow**: validate screen dimensions (max 10000x10000),
  use `size_t` for buffer size and `xcalloc_array` for allocation.
- **`builtin_join` overflow**: use `size_t` for length accumulation and
  `xmalloc`/`xmalloc_array` for allocations instead of raw `malloc`.
- **Test runner injection**: pass values to Python via `sys.argv` instead of
  shell-interpolated string in `check_range`.

### Hardening
- Eliminate all `sprintf` from the codebase — replaced with bounds-checked
  `snprintf` in `hash.c` (`bytes_to_hex`) and `builtins.c` (`random_hex`).
- Eliminate all `strcpy` — replaced with `memcpy` of known-length constants
  in `lint.c` and `main.c`.
- Zero unsafe string functions (`sprintf`, `strcpy`, `strcat`, `gets`) remain.

## [0.9.3.2] — 2026-04-25

### Security
- **Lexer indent_stack overflow**: bounds-check indent depth (max 64 levels)
  before pushing to stack-allocated array.
- **Parser list/dict literal overflow**: bounds-check element count (max 1024)
  before writing to heap-allocated array.
- **`read_file_util` ftell guard**: reject negative ftell return before
  allocating and reading — prevents heap overflow on unseekable files.
- **`compute_entropy` depth guard**: cap recursion at 64 levels to prevent
  stack overflow on deeply nested list/dict values.
- **`value_to_string` depth guard**: same cap, returns `[...]` at depth 64.
- **CORS header injection**: strip `\r` and `\n` from CORS origin to prevent
  HTTP response header injection.
- **Static file TOCTOU**: serve the realpath-resolved canonical path instead
  of the original request path, closing the symlink-swap window.
- **HTTP route handler leak**: free TokenList after each request to prevent
  per-request memory leak under sustained traffic.
- **Model JSON array overread**: check for `]` before each element read in
  `json_parse_1d_array` to avoid reading past short arrays.
- **`save_model_weights` loop bounds**: use `size_t` for `vs * dm` loop bounds
  to prevent int overflow.

### Hardening
- **`env_set_local`**: emit diagnostic when scope exceeds MAX_VARS (512)
  instead of silently dropping bindings.

## [0.9.3.1] — 2026-04-24

### Security
- **Handle table**: Store, Thread, and Channel handles now use a validated
  handle table instead of storing raw C pointers as doubles. Forged or stale
  handle IDs return null instead of dereferencing arbitrary memory.
- **copy_into**: reject negative offset (was heap corruption via OOB write).
- **tensor_to_flat**: prevent integer overflow on large tensor dimensions via
  `safe_size_mul` and 10M element cap.
- **ext_db**: fix JSON injection in `db_connect` error path and
  `db_query_json` column names — replaced manual string interpolation with
  `eigs_json_escape_string`.
- **ext_http**: generate session IDs from `/dev/urandom` instead of
  predictable `time()+counter`; use stack-local buffer instead of static.
- **ext_http**: route code handlers now execute in an isolated child
  environment so side-effects don't leak across requests.

### Hardening
- Makefile: enable `_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2`, PIE, and full RELRO.

### Docs
- ARCHITECTURE.md: fix stale function names (`eval_stmt`→`eval_node`,
  `EigenValue`→`Value`, lexer location `eigenscript.c`→`lexer.c`).

## [0.9.3] — 2026-04-22

  titration, climate modeling, signal analysis.

### Hardening
- Documented Euler invariant in range builtin, suppressed cppcheck false flag

  new `AST_INDEX_ASSIGN` node. Supports chained access: `items[0].x is 10`,
  `grid[r][c] is val`. 15 tests.
- **Real concurrency**: 12 global variables converted to `__thread` thread-local
  storage. Each OS thread gets its own eval state, error handling, and arena.
  Atomic `val_incref`/`val_decref` for thread-safe reference counting.

### New Builtins

  (df_from_csv, df_select, df_where, df_sort_by, df_group_by, df_join, etc.)
- **`lib/stats.eigs`**: Statistical functions — 18 functions (mean, median,
  std_dev, variance, quantile, histogram, correlation, describe, etc.)

  bulk_put, to_dataframe
- **`lib/ui.eigs`**: UI toolkit (see above)

  break/continue, imports, observer interrogatives with real entropy tracking,
  80+ C builtin bridge

- GC coverage: val_free for all value types (string, list, dict, function)
- Import error path coverage (module not found, parse errors)
- Terminal builtin coverage (screen_*, raw_key)
- EigenStore CRUD + persistence tests
- Concurrency tests (spawn/join, channels, producer/consumer)

## [0.8.1] — 2026-04-17

### New Builtins
- **`monotonic_ns` / `monotonic_ms`**: high-precision monotonic timer via
  `clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)` — sub-millisecond precision, no fork,
  no shell. For per-frame perf instrumentation.

### Runtime
- **System stdlib resolution**: `load_file` and `import` now search
  executable-relative stdlib paths and `~/.local/lib/eigenscript/` as fallback
  after CWD and script-relative paths. Source-tree binaries can find
  `../lib/*.eigs`, installed binaries can find `../lib/eigenscript/*.eigs`, and
  `make install` still copies `lib/*.eigs` to the user-local directory.
  External projects (Tidepool, iLambdaAi) can use stdlib without copying files.

### Documentation
- Gap analysis for real-world program classes (CLI tools, web servers,
  games, data pipelines, ML training)
- ROADMAP.md updated with all completed features by version
- Review findings from 0.8.0 high-level review addressed

### Testing
- 614 tests (up from 614 in 0.8.0 — timer builtins covered by existing
  infra)

## [0.8.0] — 2026-04-17

### Language
- **`unobserved` block**: user-level opt-out of observer tracking. Inside
  the block, numeric assignments to local vars and dict fields mutate the
  existing `Value` in place (identity preserved, `data.num` updated), and
  `update_observer` is skipped. Outside the block, normal observed
  semantics resume unchanged. Nested blocks compose via a depth counter.
  Measurement: ~22% faster on a 200k-iteration mutation hot loop. Covered
  by 8 new tests in `tests/test_unobserved.eigs`. Syntax:
  ```
  unobserved:
      game.px is game.px + game.vx * DT
  ```

### Hardening
- **Refcount GC — unified teardown path**: `free_value` and `value_free`
  collapsed into a single `free_value` that handles all composite types
  (STR, JSON_RAW, LIST, DICT, FN) and uses `val_decref` for child
  teardown. Previously two near-duplicate functions coexisted: one had no
  DICT/FN handling (silent leak when `val_decref` freed a dict), the
  other recursed with the wrong function on dict children (double-free
  risk on shared Values). Unified path is both leak-free and
  sharing-safe. Two regression tests added for shared values across
  lists and dicts.
- **Bitwise builtins — type checks + defined shift semantics**:
  `bit_and/or/xor/shl/shr` now validate both args are `VAL_NUM` before
  dereferencing `.data.num` (previously read a garbage union field on
  type mismatch — undefined behavior). Shift counts masked with `& 31`
  so `bit_shl of [1, 32]` and similar have defined behavior instead of
  relying on x86's natural modulo-shift. Uses `uint32_t` internally with
  a final cast back to `int32_t` for sign preservation. +6 test checks.

### Security
- **Stack buffer overflow in f-string lexer (high)**: `src/lexer.c:206` wrote
  into a 64 KB stack buffer without bounds-checking the accumulator index.
  An f-string literal segment longer than 64 KB would overrun the stack and
  crash (or corrupt adjacent frames). Deployments that accept untrusted
  `.eigs` source are advised to upgrade. Fixed as part of the strbuf
  migration below.
- **HTTP 404 response JSON injection (low)**: `send_404` in `src/ext_http.c`
  interpolated the unescaped request path into the JSON body. A crafted URL
  containing `"` could break the JSON structure. The path is now omitted from
  the response body (server-side logs still record it).
- **HTTP static-file confinement hardened (medium)**: `src/ext_http.c` now
  resolves the candidate path and the configured `static_dir` with `realpath`
  and rejects anything whose resolved prefix is not the root. This replaces
  the previous `strstr(rel, "..")` check and also defends against symlinks
  inside `static_dir` that point outside it. New regression test `HS06b`
  covers the symlink-escape case.
- **Threat model documented in `SECURITY.md`**: clarifies that `.eigs`
  authors are trusted (the runtime gives scripts the same file/process/network
  access the host user has), while the runtime itself must be safe against
  malformed input, crafted HTTP requests, and malicious model files.

### Hardening
- **Overflow-safe allocator helpers**: new `safe_size_mul`, `xmalloc_array`,
  `xcalloc_array`, `xrealloc_array` in `src/arena.c` abort cleanly on
  `nmemb * size` wrap. Migrated multiplicative allocations across
  `model_io.c`, `model_infer.c`, `model_train.c`, `parser.c`, `lexer.c`,
  `eigenscript.c`, `builtins.c`. `tensor_load` now rejects `rows*cols`
  that exceed `INT_MAX` up front.
- **Growable string buffers replace fixed MAX_STR ceilings**: new
  `src/strbuf.c` helper with doubling growth. Adopted by f-string and
  regular-string lexing, `regex_replace`, JSON encoder/parser,
  `value_to_string` (list + dict), and REPL stdin. Strings, regex
  output, JSON, and f-strings now grow with memory instead of silently
  truncating at 64 KB.
- **Dynamic HTTP request buffer**: `src/ext_http.c handle_request` now
  allocates a heap reqbuf that grows via `xrealloc_array`, replacing
  the 1 MB stack array. Default body cap raised from 1 MB → 16 MiB,
  configurable at runtime via `EIGS_HTTP_MAX_BODY`.
- **`strcpy`/`strcat` hardening**: `src/eval.c:164` string concatenation
  rewritten with `memcpy` + pre-computed lengths for consistency with
  the rest of the hardened codebase.
- Deleted `MAX_STR` / `MAX_BODY` / `MAX_HEADER` from `eigenscript.h`
  (no remaining consumers).

### Architecture
- **`builtins.c` split**: tensor code (~990 lines — all `builtin_tensor_*`,
  `builtin_random_normal`, `builtin_numerical_grad*`, `builtin_sgd_update*`,
  `builtin_tensor_save/load` plus their static helpers) moved to new
  `src/builtins_tensor.c`. Cross-TU prototypes live in new
  `src/builtins_internal.h`. `builtins.c` dropped from 3079 → 2091 lines.

### BREAKING
- Default HTTP request body cap rose from 1 MB to 16 MiB. Deployments
  that relied on the 1 MB ceiling as a DoS mitigation should set
  `EIGS_HTTP_MAX_BODY=1048576`.

### Testing
- 4 new large-buffer regression tests (`test_large_strings`,
  `test_fstring_large`, `test_regex_large`, `test_json_large`) that
  would fail against v0.7.0 with silent truncation or stack overflow.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-04-16

### Language
- **Pattern matching**: `match expr: case pattern: ...` with wildcard `_`
- **Pipe operator**: `data |> transform |> sort` — left-to-right data flow
- **Lambda expressions**: `(x) => x * 2` — inline anonymous functions with closure capture
- **Break/continue**: proper loop control flow
- **Dot-assignment**: `config.name is "value"` on dicts
- **Multiline collections**: lists and dicts can span multiple lines
- **Regex builtins**: `regex_match`, `regex_find`, `regex_replace` (POSIX ERE)
- **Import system**: `import math` loads modules into namespaced dicts

### Architecture
- **Source split**: monolithic `eigenscript.c` → `lexer.c`, `parser.c`, `eval.c`, `builtins.c`
- **OOM-safe allocations**: all value constructors use `xmalloc`/`xcalloc` wrappers
- **Recursion depth guard**: `eval_node` checks against max depth to prevent stack overflow
- **Stack protector**: `-fstack-protector-strong` enabled in builds

### Security
- Fixed shell injection in `ls` builtin
- Hardened `strcpy` into fixed-size op fields with `snprintf`
- Reject negative/malformed Content-Length in HTTP server
- Reject out-of-range model dimensions; safe `size_t` casts in weight allocations
- Softmax NaN guard: zero-sum falls back to uniform distribution
- Three stdlib correctness fixes (math, template, test modules)

### Testing

## [0.6.0] — 2026-04-16

### Language
- **REPL**: Run `eigenscript` with no arguments for an interactive session
- **Named function parameters**: `define add(a, b) as:` — no more manual `n[0]`/`n[1]` unpacking
- **String interpolation**: `f"Hello {name}, {x * 2}"` — expressions inside braces are evaluated
- **Native dictionaries**: first-class dictionary type with `{}` literals and `.key` access
- **eval builtin**: `eval of "expr"` — evaluate a string as EigenScript at runtime
- Backward compatible: `define foo as:` with single `n` argument still works
- `n` is always available in all functions for compatibility with existing code

### Error Handling
- **try/catch blocks**: `try: ... catch err: ...` — runtime errors are now recoverable
- **throw builtin**: `throw of "message"` — raise errors from user code
- Nested try/catch with re-throw support
- All runtime errors (undefined variable, type error, index out of bounds, etc.) are catchable

### Meta-Circular Interpreter
- **lib/eigen.eigs**: EigenScript interpreter written in EigenScript
- Tokenizer, parser, and evaluator implemented in pure EigenScript
- `eigen_run of source` evaluates EigenScript source strings end-to-end

### Closures
- Functions capture their defining environment (already worked, now documented)
- `make_adder`, `make_multiplier`, factory patterns all work correctly

### Code Quality
- Removed `n` binding bloat from named-param functions
- All 25 stdlib modules converted to named parameters
- Fixed potential snprintf buffer overflow in list-to-string conversion (CodeQL #14-16)
- Added least-privilege permissions to CI workflow (CodeQL #17)

## [0.5.0] — 2025-04-03
