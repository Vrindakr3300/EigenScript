# Architecture

EigenScript is a bytecode-compiled language with a stack-based virtual machine,
written in C. The runtime is a single binary with no external dependencies
(minimal build) or optional extensions for HTTP, PostgreSQL, SDL2 graphics,
and transformer models (full build).

### Lexer

The lexer (`tokenize()` in `lexer.c`) converts source text into a flat
array of tokens. EigenScript uses indentation-significant syntax — the lexer
tracks indent depth and emits INDENT/DEDENT tokens.

### Parser

The recursive-descent parser (`parse()`) builds an AST with 31 node types.
Each node has a type (assignment, if, for, while, define, return, etc.) and
child expressions. Expressions use a Pratt-style precedence parser.

### Compiler

The compiler (`compile_ast()` in `compiler.c`) walks the AST and emits a
flat bytecode array with 60+ opcodes into an `EigsChunk`. Each chunk has:

- **Bytecode array** — compact `[op:8][arg:16LE]` encoding
- **Constant pool** — deduplicated numbers and strings
- **Line number table** — for error messages
- **Nested function chunks** — compiled function bodies

The compiler tracks stack depth at compile time to validate that each
statement and branch path maintains correct stack balance. Function
parameters are assigned local slot indices for fast access via
`OP_GET_LOCAL`/`OP_SET_LOCAL` (direct env array index, no hash lookup).

### VM

The bytecode VM (`vm_execute()` / `vm_run()` in `vm.c`) uses a single
dispatch loop with GCC computed-goto (`&&label` / `goto *table[op]`)
for the hot path, with a switch fallback for other compilers.

Key design decisions:

- **Non-recursive function calls.** `OP_CALL` pushes a new `CallFrame`
  and continues the dispatch loop. `OP_RETURN` pops the frame and
  resumes the caller. No C stack recursion — function call depth is
  limited only by `VM_FRAMES_MAX` (4096), not the C stack.

- **Env-based variable storage.** Variables are stored in `Env` hash
  tables (the same structure used pre-VM). Function parameters use
  `OP_GET_LOCAL`/`OP_SET_LOCAL` for direct slot access, bypassing
  hash lookup. Non-param variables use `OP_GET_NAME`/`OP_SET_NAME`
  with full scope-chain walk.

- **Re-entrant execution.** `vm_execute` can be called recursively
  from builtins (`load_file`, `eval`, `import`, `dispatch`). Each
  re-entrant call tracks its `base_frame` and returns to C when
  unwinding past it.

- **`fn_env` separation.** Each `CallFrame` has both `env` (current
  env, which changes during `OP_LOOP_ENV_FRESH` for-loop scoping)
  and `fn_env` (the function's original env, used by
  `OP_GET_LOCAL`/`OP_SET_LOCAL` to avoid slot collision with
  loop variables).

### Observer

The observer system tracks entropy and rate-of-change for every assigned
variable. The six trajectory states are:

- **improving** — entropy is decreasing
- **diverging** — entropy is increasing
- **stable** — entropy is changing slowly
- **equilibrium** — entropy has nearly stopped changing
- **oscillating** — dH is sign-flipping
- **converged** — entropy is very low and stable

Observer state is accessible via interrogatives (`what`, `who`, `when`,
`where`, `why`, `how`) and predicates (`converged`, `stable`, etc.),
and drives `loop while not converged` termination.

Observation uses lazy evaluation: `OP_OBSERVE_ASSIGN` marks values dirty
(O(1)), and entropy is computed on demand when observer state is read.
The last observed value is tracked via a thread-local pointer
(`g_last_observer`). `unobserved` blocks skip observer marking entirely.

Loop stall detection (`OP_LOOP_STALL_CHECK`) exits while-loops after 100
consecutive iterations with `|dH| < threshold`, setting `__loop_exit__`
and `__loop_iterations__` env variables.

## Memory

EigenScript uses a hybrid memory model: reference counting, arena bump
allocation, a numeric freelist, and environment freelists.

**Reference counting.** Every heap-allocated `Value` has an atomic refcount
(`__ATOMIC_RELAXED` increment, `__ATOMIC_ACQ_REL` decrement). When the
refcount reaches zero, `free_value` tears down the value and its children.
Arena-allocated values (`v->arena == 1`) skip refcounting entirely — they
are reclaimed in bulk by `arena_reset`.

**Arena allocator.** The arena (`arena.c`) provides fast bump allocation in
16 MB blocks (up to 64 blocks). Scripts use `arena_mark`/`arena_reset` to
reclaim transient memory in bounded-computation loops.

**Numeric freelist.** Freed `VAL_NUM` values are placed in a per-thread
freelist (up to 4096 entries) and reused by `make_num`, avoiding
malloc/free churn in arithmetic-heavy loops.

**Environment freelist.** Freed `Env` structs are cached per-thread (up to
1024 entries) and reused by `env_new`, avoiding allocation in tight
function-call loops.

**Closure environments.** Environments captured by closures
(`env->captured = 1`) track a reference count (`env_refcount`, atomic).
When the last closure referencing an env is freed, the env becomes
eligible for cleanup.

## Extensions

Extensions are conditionally compiled via flags:

| Flag | Extension | Dependency |
|------|-----------|------------|
| `EIGENSCRIPT_EXT_HTTP` | HTTP server | none (uses raw sockets) |
| `EIGENSCRIPT_EXT_DB` | PostgreSQL | libpq |
| `EIGENSCRIPT_EXT_MODEL` | Transformer | none |
| `EIGENSCRIPT_EXT_GFX` | SDL2 graphics | libSDL2 (loaded at runtime via `dlopen`) |

The minimal build (`make build`) sets all flags to 0. The full build
(`make full`) enables everything.

## Standard Library

The 49 modules in `lib/` are pure EigenScript — no C code. They are loaded at
runtime via `load_file of "lib/module.eigs"`. Path resolution searches relative
to the executable's directory, then the current working directory, then the
script's directory.

The meta-circular interpreter (`lib/eigen.eigs`) implements tokenization,
parsing, and evaluation of EigenScript source code in EigenScript itself.
