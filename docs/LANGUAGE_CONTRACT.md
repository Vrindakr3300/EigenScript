# The EigenScript Language Contract

This is the list of semantic promises EigenScript makes — the decisions
every language must make, stated explicitly so they're chosen on purpose
rather than discovered by surprise. Each promise has a **status**:

- **Enforced** — the implementation guarantees it and a test locks it.
- **Planned** — the intended contract; the implementation doesn't fully
  enforce it yet (noted so the gap is visible, not hidden).

When you add a feature, add its row here *first*. Writing the promise down
is what forces you to notice the decisions you haven't made.

---

## Equality — `==` / `!=`

**Promise:** Structural for collections, by-value for scalars, by-identity
for functions. No cross-type coercion: operands of different types are
never equal (and it is never an error to compare them).

- Numbers, strings, null: by value (`3 == 3.0`, `"a" == "a"`).
- Lists: equal iff same length and elementwise-equal (recursive).
- Dicts: equal iff same keys with equal values (order-independent).
- Buffers / text-builders: by contents.
- Functions, builtins: by identity.
- Mixed types: `"3" == 3` is `false`, never an error.

**Status:** Enforced — `tests/test_equality.eigs`, `values_equal()` in
`eigenscript.c`.

## Ordering — `<` `>` `<=` `>=`

**Promise:** Both operands must be the same comparable type — number/number
or string/string (lexicographic). Comparing mixed or uncomparable types
**raises** a runtime error (it does not silently return false).

**Status:** Enforced — `tests/test_coercion.eigs`.

## Coercion

**Promise:** None. EigenScript does not implicitly convert between types.
`+` adds two numbers or concatenates two strings; a mixed operand raises.
To build text from mixed types, use an f-string (`f"n={count}"`) or
`str of` / `num of`.

**Status:** Enforced — `tests/test_coercion.eigs`.

## Errors

**Promise:** A runtime error (undefined variable, bad index, calling a
non-function, type-mismatched operator, bad builtin argument, stack
overflow) is recoverable with `try`/`catch`. If uncaught, it is **fatal**:
execution stops and the process exits non-zero. Programs never continue
past an unrecovered error or report success on failure. Warnings (e.g.
division by zero, which yields 0) are not errors and do not stop execution.

**Status:** Enforced — `run_all_tests.sh` EM14–EM18, `tests/test_trycatch.eigs`.

## Numbers

**Promise:**
- One numeric type: IEEE-754 double. Integers are exact up to 2^53.
- Finite by construction: no NaN, no Infinity. NaN-producing operations
  return 0; overflow saturates at ±1e308; division by zero warns and
  yields 0.
- `str of` produces the shortest representation that round-trips back to
  the same double; `num of (str of x) == x`.
- `%` follows the dividend's sign (C semantics): `-7 % 3 == -1`.

**Status:** Enforced — `tests/test_number_format.eigs`,
`tests/test_numeric_guard.eigs`.

## Strings

**Promise:** A string is a sequence of **bytes**, not Unicode codepoints.
- `len` returns the **byte** count (`len of "café"` is 5, not 4).
- Indexing `s[i]` returns the one-byte string at byte offset `i`; all string
  builtins (`split`, `index_of`, `substr`, `contains`, `upper`/`lower`, …)
  operate bytewise. A multi-byte UTF-8 sequence is therefore split by
  byte-offset operations — this is the documented consequence of the byte
  model, not a bug.
- Strings are immutable; comparison (`==`, `<`) is bytewise.
- String literals support the escapes `\n \t \\ \"`. There is no `\0`,
  `\xNN`, or `\u{…}` escape, so a string cannot embed a NUL or an arbitrary
  byte from source (only the raw bytes present in the source file flow
  through). An embedded NUL, if one ever arrived from file/buffer input,
  would truncate the string at that byte.

Unicode-correct length, indexing, and iteration are intentionally **out of
core scope**: they are an O(n) walk or a per-string index cache, a poor trade
for the runtime's targets. They may be added later as **opt-in helpers**
(e.g. `utf8_len`, `utf8_chars`) — purely additive, so this promise does not
foreclose them.

**Status:** Enforced — `builtin_len` (byte count) and the string index paths
in `builtins.c` / `vm.c`.

## Bitwise — `&` `|` `^` `<<` `>>` `~`

**Promise:** Bitwise operators (and the `bit_and` / `bit_or` / `bit_xor` /
`bit_not` / `bit_shl` / `bit_shr` builtins) operate on 32-bit two's-complement
integers; operands are truncated toward zero to `int32`. Shift amounts are
masked to `[0,31]`, so large or negative shifts are defined, not UB.
Non-numeric operands **raise** a runtime error — they are not silently
treated as `0`. This is the same strict error model the arithmetic operators
use; it makes the **Errors** promise ("type-mismatched operator … raises")
hold for *every* operator with no exceptions.

**Status:** Enforced — `tests/test_bitwise.eigs`, `INT_BINOP` / `CASE(BNOT)`
in `vm.c`, `bit_*` builtins in `builtins.c`.

## Truthiness

**Promise:** Falsy values are `0`, `""`, `[]`, `{}`, and `null`. Everything
else is truthy (including functions).

**Status:** Enforced — `tests/test_coverage_v2.eigs` (CV2-87/88).

## Scope & binding

**Promise:**
- Lexical scope. Functions capture their defining environment (closures).
- For-loop variables are block-scoped — they do not leak after the loop,
  and each iteration binds a fresh variable (so closures created in a loop
  capture distinct values).
- Name resolution walks the scope chain; an unresolved name is a fatal
  runtime error.
- Functions resolve referenced names at call time (late binding), so
  mutual recursion works regardless of definition order; but a *top-level*
  call must follow the definition in source order.

**Status:** Enforced — `tests/test_closures.eigs`,
`tests/test_scope_semantics.eigs`.

## Evaluation

**Promise:** `and` / `or` short-circuit and return the deciding operand
(`5 and 3 == 3`, `0 or 7 == 7`).

**Status:** Enforced.

## Mutability & aliasing

**Promise:** Assignment binds a reference, it does not copy. Lists and
dicts are reference types: after `b is a`, mutating `b` (e.g. `b[0] is 9`)
also changes `a`. Numbers and strings are immutable, so sharing them is
unobservable. To get an independent copy, copy explicitly.

**Status:** Enforced (behavior) — `tests/test_call_semantics.eigs`.

## Function calls & argument unpacking

**Promise:** `f of X` calls `f` with argument `X`.
- If `X` is a **literal list of length ≥ 2**, the elements are spread
  across the callee's parameters in order. Extra elements are ignored;
  missing parameters are `null`. So `momentum of [2, 3]` passes
  `m=2, v=3`.
- A **literal list of length 1** is *not* spread — `f of [x]` binds
  the one-element list `[x]` as a single argument, regardless of the
  callee's arity. (See the default-params footgun below.)
- If `f` has **exactly one** parameter, the *entire* argument binds to it —
  a list is **not** spread. So `mean of [1,2,3,4]` passes the whole list.
- An empty literal list `f of []` is a **zero-arg call**, so a function
  with all-default params runs every default.
- To pass a single scalar to a multi-param (or any) function, use the
  parenthesized form: `f of (x)` is always a one-argument call binding
  `x` to the first parameter (later params take defaults or `null`).
  `f of x` is the same one-argument form when `x` isn't a list literal.

**Status:** Enforced — `tests/test_call_semantics.eigs`.

## Default parameter values (0.13.0)

**Promise:** A parameter may carry a default expression: `define f(a, b is expr) as: ...`.
- Defaults are **trailing-only** — once a parameter has a default, every
  following parameter must also have one. `define f(a is 1, b)` is a
  parse error.
- The default expression is **re-evaluated on every call** that omits
  the argument (no shared mutable-default footgun).
- A default expression can reference any earlier parameter in the same
  signature, as well as any name visible in the enclosing scope at
  call time. Earlier-param references resolve against the values just
  bound for *this* call.
- `null` passed explicitly is a real argument — defaults **do not**
  fire for it. To request the default, call with fewer arguments. For
  a single-parameter function with a default, write `f of []` to call
  with zero args (since `f of null` would bind `null`).
- Lambdas (`(x) -> expr`, `lambda` blocks) do **not** support
  defaults.
- **Footgun (issue #153):** `f of [x]` does *not* spread to a
  multi-param defaulted function. Per the call-spread rule above, a
  length-1 literal list binds as one argument, so `f` receives the list
  `[x]` as its first param — defaults can then fail or surprise
  (e.g. `define fib(n, memo is 0)` with `fib of [n - 1]` binds
  `n = [n - 1]`, then `n < 2` raises "compare list and num").
  Use the parenthesized form `f of (x)` for the one-arg case:
  `fib of (n - 1)` binds `n = n - 1` and lets `memo` default.
- **Behavior change in 0.13.0 (issue #154):** `f of []` now lowers to
  a **zero-arg call** for every callee arity. On a multi-param
  function `g(a, b)` it binds `a = null, b = null` (matches the
  contract's "missing parameters are `null`"); on `g(a, b is 100)`
  the `b`-default fires and it binds `a = null, b = 100` (per #158,
  see below). Prior to 0.13.0 the empty-list literal was treated like
  any other single list argument and bound `a = [], b = null`.
  Single-param non-defaulted callees are preserved by a compile-time
  special case (`one of []` still binds `a = []` there) so existing
  code that did `f of []` to pass an empty list to a 1-arg function
  keeps working.
- **Defaults fire whenever the slot is unsupplied (issue #158):**
  An underfed call binds every supplied positional slot, then fires
  the default expression for any defaulted slot the caller skipped —
  even when `argc < first_default`. So `define f(a, b, c is 1); f of
  5` binds `a = 5, b = null, c = 1`; `f of []` binds `a = null, b =
  null, c = 1`. Prior to the fix, defaults only fired when `argc >=
  first_default`, so an underfed call below that threshold silently
  left the defaulted tail `null`.

**Status:** Enforced — `tests/test_default_params.eigs`.

## Destructuring assignment (0.13.0)

**Promise:** `[a, b, c] is rhs` evaluates `rhs` once, requires it to be
a list of length exactly 3, and binds `a` `b` `c` to its elements in
order.
- **Length is strict:** mismatch raises a runtime error. No
  truncation, no padding with `null`, no clamping. Matches the same
  decision as out-of-range indexing.
- **Type is strict:** the RHS must be a list. A non-list (number,
  string, dict, buffer, null) raises. To convert, do it explicitly
  before the destructure.
- **RHS evaluated exactly once:** side effects fire once and the
  result is unpacked. So `[a, b] is mkpair of null` calls `mkpair`
  once even though two names are bound.
- **Swap works:** `[a, b] is [b, a]` builds the RHS list first, then
  unpacks — so the two reads happen before either write.
- **Plain identifiers only (v1):** the LHS is `[ IDENT (, IDENT)* ]`.
  Nested patterns (`[a, [b, c]] is ...`), index/field targets
  (`[items[0], obj.field] is ...`), and rest patterns (`[a, *rest]`)
  are not supported yet; ambient-list-literal expressions still
  parse as expressions (lookahead requires the trailing `]` to be
  followed by `is`).

**Status:** Enforced — `tests/test_destructuring.eigs`.

## Streaming subprocess I/O (0.13.0)

**Promise:** A six-builtin surface for interacting with a child process
over time, sibling to the all-at-once `exec_capture`. The child runs
with its stdin and stdout connected to anonymous pipes that the parent
reads/writes directly with `read(2)`/`write(2)` — no parent-side stdio
buffering, no shell.

- `proc_spawn of ["cmd", "arg1", ...]` — fork+execvp; returns
  `[pid, in_fd, out_fd]`. On failure returns `[-1, -1, -1]`. The
  child's stderr is inherited from the parent. Empty argv is the
  failure sentinel.
- `proc_write of [in_fd, "text"]` — full blocking write to the child's
  stdin. Returns bytes written. Returns `-1` if the child has closed
  stdin (EPIPE) or on any other error. SIGPIPE is masked process-wide
  on first spawn so writes get EPIPE instead of killing the parent.
- `proc_read_line of out_fd` — reads bytes from the child's stdout
  until `\n` or EOF. Returns the line without the trailing newline.
  Returns `null` only at EOF with an empty buffer; an EOF that
  follows a partial line returns that partial line.
- `proc_read of [out_fd, max_bytes]` — single `read(2)` of up to
  `max_bytes` bytes (capped internally at 10 MB). Returns a string;
  may return fewer bytes than requested. Returns `null` on EOF.
  Null bytes in the stream truncate the returned string at the first
  one (EigenScript strings are C-terminated).
- `proc_close of fd` — `close(2)`; idempotent (a bad fd is a no-op).
- `proc_wait of pid` — blocking `waitpid`; returns the exit code,
  `128 + signal` if the child was killed by a signal, or `-1` on
  error.

**Buffering note:** EigenScript's reads are unbuffered, but a child
that uses stdio block-buffers its own output when stdout is not a
tty. To get line-streaming behavior from such a child, invoke it via
`stdbuf -oL` or `stdbuf -o0` (or use a child that flushes after every
line). The runtime cannot change the child's stdio mode for it.

**No automatic cleanup:** the returned fds and pid are raw OS
resources, not GC-managed handles. Callers must `proc_close` both
fds and `proc_wait` the pid to avoid zombies and fd leaks. A future
revision may add a `with`-style scoped form; v1 stays explicit.

**Status:** Enforced — `tests/test_proc_stream.eigs`.

## Operator precedence

From lowest (binds loosest) to highest (binds tightest):

| Level | Operators | Notes |
|------:|-----------|-------|
| 1 | `\|>` | pipe |
| 2 | `or` | |
| 3 | `and` | |
| 4 | `==` `!=` `<` `>` `<=` `>=` | comparison |
| 5 | `\|` | bitwise OR |
| 6 | `^` | bitwise XOR |
| 7 | `&` | bitwise AND |
| 8 | `<<` `>>` | shift |
| 9 | `+` `-` | |
| 10 | `*` `/` `%` | |
| 11 | `-` `not` `~` | unary (prefix) |
| 12 | `of` | function application |
| 13 | `[]` `.` `( )` | indexing, field access, grouping |

Two consequences worth knowing:
- **Bitwise binds tighter than comparison** (unlike C). `x & mask == 0`
  parses as `(x & mask) == 0` — the intended reading, avoiding C's classic
  footgun.
- **`of` binds tighter than arithmetic.** `len of xs - 1` is
  `(len of xs) - 1`; `sqrt of x + 1` is `(sqrt of x) + 1`. Parenthesize
  the argument when it's an expression: `sqrt of (x + 1)`.

**Status:** Enforced (parser). Binary operators are left-associative;
unary and `of` are right-associative.

## Indexing — `[ ]`

**Promise (decision):** An index must be an integer in `[-length, length)`.
- Negative indices count from the end: `a[-1]` is the last element,
  `a[-len of a]` is the first. Resolution is `i + len` *before* the
  bounds check, matching Python and Ruby.
- Out-of-range indices (including too-negative, e.g. `a[-(len+1)]`)
  raise a runtime error.
- A non-integer index **raises** (`a[1.5]` → error). Integer-valued doubles
  are accepted (`a[2.0]` works), since EigenScript has a single number type;
  but a fractional value is never silently truncated. Because `/` always
  yields a double, a division-derived index must be collapsed explicitly —
  `a[floor of (lo + hi) / 2]` — which keeps the rounding decision in the
  programmer's hands. A value that is fractional only through float drift
  (`2.9999998`) also raises, surfacing the sloppy arithmetic rather than
  mis-indexing.

**Status:** Enforced — `tests/test_trycatch.eigs`; `vm_index_is_int` guards
every dynamic index site in `OP_INDEX_GET`/`OP_INDEX_SET` and
`jit_helper_index_get` in `vm.c`.

**Slicing — `a[start:end]`, half-open with defaults and negatives.**
- **Slices** are half-open `a[start:end)`, with defaults `a[start:]`
  (end = len), `a[:end]` (start = 0), `a[:]` (the whole sequence).
- **Slice bounds are positions between elements**, so the valid range is
  `0 <= start <= end <= len` (note `<=` on the upper end): `a[len:]` and
  `a[start:len]` are legal and yield an empty slice — even though the bare
  index `a[len]` raises.
- **Out-of-range slice bounds raise** (they do not clamp), consistent with
  the single-index rule and with Rust/Go; only the coercion-happy languages
  (Python/JS) clamp. Write `min of [end, len of a]` for explicit clamping.
- Negatives resolve to absolute positions first (same rule as single
  indexing), then the `0 <= start <= end <= len` check applies.
- **The slice is an independent copy** — mutating the slice does not
  alias the source (and vice versa). Applies to lists, strings (which
  are immutable anyway), and buffers.

**Status:** Enforced — `tests/test_slicing.eigs`; `OP_SLICE_GET` in
`vm.c` for `VAL_LIST` / `VAL_STR` / `VAL_BUFFER`.

**Dict access — missing key returns `null` (deliberate, not an error).**
A missing dict key (`d["k"]`) or field (`d.k`) evaluates to `null`, on
purpose: a missing key is a *lookup miss*, not a logic error. This is
distinct from out-of-range **list** indexing, which raises — an out-of-range
list index is a logic error. Both forms of dict access (`d.k` and `d["k"]`)
agree. Use `has_key of [d, "k"]` to test membership when `null` is itself a
valid stored value.

**Status:** Enforced — `tests/test_dict.eigs`, `OP_DOT_GET` /
`OP_INDEX_GET` in `vm.c`.

## Statistics convention (library)

**Promise:** `variance` / `std_dev` are **population** statistics (÷N).
`variance_sample` / `std_dev_sample` are the sample estimators with
Bessel's correction (÷N−1).

**Status:** Enforced — `tests/test_stem_accuracy.eigs`, `lib/stats.eigs`.

## How to use this document

1. Before implementing a feature, write its promise here and pick its
   answer deliberately — borrow the conventional answer unless you have a
   reason not to.
2. Write the contract test (`tests/test_*.eigs`) that pins the promise,
   then make the implementation satisfy it.
3. Keep the **status** honest. A row marked Enforced must have a passing
   test; a gap is marked Planned, never hidden.

The point isn't to memorize language theory — it's that writing the
contract down forces you to notice the decisions you haven't made yet.
