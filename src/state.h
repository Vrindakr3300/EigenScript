/*
 * EigsState / EigsThread — interpreter and per-thread execution context.
 *
 * Part of the multi-state refactor (see docs/EMBEDDING.md once Phase 10
 * lands):
 *
 *   - EigsState:  one per interpreter instance. Will own the global
 *                 env, script/exe dirs, observer thresholds, module
 *                 cache, handle table, ext singletons. Currently holds
 *                 only the attached-threads registry.
 *   - EigsThread: one per OS thread that has entered a state. Owns the
 *                 arena and the error/return/control-flow state
 *                 (Phase 3). Will grow to own the VM, observer-current
 *                 pointer, JIT caches, allocator freelists.
 *
 * EigsThread is transparent (struct definition in eigenscript.h) so the
 * legacy `g_arena`, `g_returning`, `g_error_msg`, ... identifiers can be
 * macros that expand to `eigs_current->field` — same single-indirection
 * cost as the original `__thread X g_X` direct access. EigsState stays
 * opaque to internal TUs.
 *
 * Re-attach on the same OS thread is explicitly forbidden; nested
 * states need a save/restore stack (Phase 10 work).
